Most languages conflate one or more of these mechanisms, but inPLOT they are independent and orthogonal.<P>Files are the units of source code.  This makes them the units of compilationand of loading executable code.  Breaking a program into multiple files easesmaintenance and delivery of the program, especially when differentindividuals or organizations are responsible for different files.<P>Modules are the units of global name scoping.  A module can inherit nameddefinitions from other modules, with renaming.  Breaking a program intomultiple modules makes name conflict issues tractable.<P>Types are the units of data classification.  A type is a dichotomy thatclassifies every object as either a member of the type or not a member ofthe type.  Classes are the most important type of type in PLOT.  A classdefines the structure of its member objects as a set of named slots thatcan hold values.  A class can inherit typeness and slots from another class.<P>Functions are the units of behavior.  In PLOT all functions are composite,being constructed at load time from one or more pieces of executable codecalled methods.<P>Macros are the units of language definition.  A macro defines the syntax of aconstruct by specifying the procedure for parsing that construct, and definesthe semantics of a construct by specifying an expression that is theimplementation of that construct.  The syntax of PLOT is not built into thecompiler, but is entirely defined by macros (many of which are defined by theimplementation rather than by the user, ofcourse).  The compiler is only concerned with the semantics of the primitiveexpressions.  This enables users to define their own languages based on PLOTwhich are every bit as flexible, powerful, and clean as the base language.<P>A few examples of the orthogonality of these mechanisms:<P><UL><LI> The source code in a given file need not be related to just one class, norbe contained in just one module.</LI><LI> The source code for methods applicable to a given class need not be all inone file nor all in one module.</LI><LI> Methods can be added to an existing function at load time, which means atany time because you can load additional code at run time.</LI><LI> The language syntax can be different in different modules, because thesyntax is determined by the macros whose names are in scope.</LI></UL><P><P><BR><P align=center><A HREF="page-2.html">Previous page</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="index.html">Table of Contents</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="page-4.html">Next page</A></P><BR><br></body></html>
