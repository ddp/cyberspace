In this case, at least the partsof the user program executed by user written macros coexist with thecompiler.  However, the compiler outputs a "fasl file" consisting ofinstructions for loading the compiled user program into another environment.Previously compiled code can be loaded into a program at run time.<P>For the compiler to compile itself and the runtime, there can be a specialcompilation environment that uses module renaming to keep the currentlyexecuting compiler and runtime separate from the new compiler and runtimethat are being compiled.<P><P><P><P><P><BR><P align=center><A HREF="page-15.html">Previous page</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="index.html">Table of Contents</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="page-17.html">Next page</A></P><BR><br></body></html>
