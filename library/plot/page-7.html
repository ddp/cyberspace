Itsconstructor can be called with two integer arguments which are the numeratorand denominator respectively.<P>The classes boolean, false, and true are immutable and have no slots and novisible constructors.<P>The class character is immutable.  Its constructor accepts an integer and returnsthe character with that character code.  The slot code contains an integer whichis the character's code.<P>The class name has no slots aside from the <TT>class</TT>slot belonging to all objects.  Its pseudo-constructor accepts a spelling, whichis a string or a name, and an optional context, which is false, a name,a module, or a macro-context.  All names are immutable.<P>The class simple-name has a spelling slot, which is a string.  Its pseudo-constructortakes a spelling string and returns the simple-name with that spelling(ignoring alphabetic case), creating it if it does not already exist.<P>The class name-in-context has a name slot, which is a simple-name, and acontext slot, which is a macro-context or a module.  Its pseudo-constructor takesname and context arguments.  The name argument can be a simple-name or a string.The context argument can be false, a name, a module, or a macro-context.A name context means the context property of that name.  If the context is falsethe result is a simple-name rather than a name-in-context.<P>The class keyword has one slot, name, which is a simple-name with the samespelling as the keyword minus the final colon.  Its pseudo-constructor accepts astring or a simple-name.  Keywords are interned, i.e. there is only oneinstance per spelling (ignoring alphabetic case).  Keywords are immutable.<P>The classes list, stack, bit-vector, and dictionary have pseudo-constructors of the same namewhich accept any number of arguments.  The arguments become the initial contentsof the constructed object.  The real constructors are list#, stack#, bit-vector#, and dictionary#which take one integer argument which is the length of a list or bit-vector or the initial capacityof a stack or dictionary; the length of a stack or dictionary created this way is zero.<P>The class string has a constructor of the same name which accepts any number ofarguments, converts them to strings, and concatenates them together to produce theconstructed object.  There is no string# since strings are immutable.<P>The class argument-list is an immutable array with no public slots or constructor.<P>The class class is explained elsewhere.<P>The class protocol has only a name slot and a multi-valued super-protocols slot.its constructor takes the corresponding arguments.The name is used to recover an equivalent protocol when doing separate compilation.<P>The class range is both an immutable array and a type.  The elements ofthe array are the members of the type in numerical order.  The constructor'sparameter list is (start is number or false, end is number or false, optional: stride is number = 1).A false start or end indicates an open-ended range, e.g. if start is 0, end is false,and stride is 1 the range includes all non-negative integers.Range has slots start, end, length, and stride.  Start and end are inclusive.<P>The class type-union has a multi-valued members slot.  The constructor's parameterlist is (rest: members is type).  This class is immutable.<P><P><BR><P align=center><A HREF="page-6.html">Previous page</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="index.html">Table of Contents</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="page-8.html">Next page</A></P><BR><br></body></html>
