Unlike iterating through a sequence,iterating through a stream changes the stream.<P>The following method requirements constitute the stream protocol:<PRE>defprotocol stream  end?(x is stream, result: end? is boolean)  next(x is stream, result: element)  advance(x is stream)</PRE>Their behavior is very similar to the methods of the same names of thesequence protocol.  There is no start-iteration method, as this happensautomatically when a stream is created.  The advance method does notreturn anything in particular.<P>There is a pseudo-constructor method <TT>stream</TT> that takes a sequence andreturns a stream that iterates through that sequence.<P><P><BR><P align=center><A HREF="page-11.html">Previous page</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="index.html">Table of Contents</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="page-13.html">Next page</A></P><BR><br></body></html>
