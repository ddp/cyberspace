I have been developing PLOT as a hobby, with the ideaof for once having a programming language which does everything the right way.You know it is right when both simplicity and power are maximized, while atthe same time confusion and the need for kludges are minimized.<P>PLOT emphasizes cleanliness, flexibility, and extensibility. PLOT sports amore conventional-looking syntax than classic Lisp.  It is, of course, fullyobject-oriented.  Perhaps the most interesting feature of PLOT is that thesyntax is totally user-definable.<P>How can this be a dialect of Lisp, you say, if it does not haveS-Expressions, does not have NIL, does not have conses, does not have atoms,and does not have a simple parenthesized Polish prefix syntax?<P>I say it is a dialect of Lisp because it uses a fully dynamic memory model,fully dynamic typing, a resident program semantics (although separatecompilation is possible), fully powerful macros (but hygienic!), and because(almost) everything about the language is defined in the language itself.  Ithas the same extreme flexibility and extensibility, and the same minimum ofnonsense that gets in your way, that have always been hallmarks of Lisp.It has the important things about Lisp while jettisoning the things thatin my opinion were mistakes from the beginning.<P>Obviously this language owes a lot to Scheme, Dylan, Common Lisp, Python, Java, and afew others.  There is a remarkable amount of convergence with Ruby,considering that I hadn't seen Ruby when I first did this.  But as compared withRuby, PLOT has macros, has my preferred non-class-centric model of methods,and is designed to be compiled.<P>This document takes an unconventional approach and describes the semanticsbefore explaining the syntax.  But, hey! it's hypertext, if you findthat approach confusing you don't have to read it in that order.<P>Maybe I should rename PLOT to Mud (Moon's Ultimate Distraction), anobvious reference to the words of an ancient sage.<P>The slides from my presentation at the 2009 International Lisp Conferenceare <A href="Moon-ILC09.pdf">here</A>.  Some of the syntax used in thoseslides is from an earlier version of the language and is no longer valid.<P><P><P><BR><P align=center>Previous page&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="index.html">Table of Contents</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="page-2.html">Next page</A></P><BR><br></body></html>
