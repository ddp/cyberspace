There is actually no distinction between astatement and an expression in PLOT; we just call an expression a statementif it tends to be used for effect or an expression if it tends to be usedfor value.<P>All of these statements are defined within the language by using macros.Their syntax is described here by showing the pattern portion of the macrodefinition, but the expansion portion is omitted.<P>Many statements use the syntactic type body.  This is a sequence of expressions;they are executed in the order written andthe last expression produces the value(s).  However, if the keyword result:appears, the expression following it is the one that produces the value(s).  Thesevalues are saved until the expressions after the result expression have been evaluated.The syntactic type body also allows a cleanup: keyword, explained below.<P>The syntactic type block is identical to body except it encloses the expressionsin a block and it allows an exit: keyword, explained below.<P><P><BR><P align=center><A HREF="page-30.html">Previous page</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="index.html">Table of Contents</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="page-32.html">Next page</A></P><BR><br></body></html>
