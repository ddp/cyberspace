A function is composedfrom one or more methods.  When a function is called, it dispatches to themost specific main method that accepts the supplied number of argumentsand the supplied keyword arguments and isapplicable to the actual types of the arguments.  If there is no applicable mainmethod, the function signals an error.<P>Function call also dispatches to applicable first and last methods, and themost specific applicable main method can invoke a less specific applicablemain method, as explained earlier.<P>Methods have zero or more required parameters and can also have optionalparameters and either an indefinite number of arguments or keyword parametersthat are identified by name in the call.  All parameters can have typerestrictions.  Optional and keyword parameters can have default values.  Amethod's parameter list can also declare the number and types of its returnvalues.<P>A method is only applicable to a call if the number of arguments in thatcall is acceptable to its parameter list.  This allows unary and binary -operators to be the same function.  It also allows [ to have a restparameter in some methods while other methods take exactly 2 arguments.There are no restrictions on compatibility of the parameter lists of twomethods that are part of the same function, unlike in Common Lisp.<P>As noted above, a type is a class, a protocol, a range of integers, or a unionof types.  (There is nothing like Common Lisp's EQL type.)<P>A method can reference definitions in any scope enclosing the method.Thus all methods are closures in the Lisp sense of closure.<P>An expression can produce multiple values.  The values are not packaged in atuple; the extra values are optional to the user of the expression, as inCommon Lisp.<P>Non-local transfers of control are possible by calling an exit function,which forces control to return from the place where the exit function wascreated.  The arguments to the exit function become the values returned.Calling an exit function destroys the intervening state; this is not likeScheme continuations.<P><P><BR><P align=center><A HREF="page-12.html">Previous page</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="index.html">Table of Contents</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="page-14.html">Next page</A></P><BR><br></body></html>
