Thelanguage is to be fully extensible by users, with no magic.  Of course to beimplementable this requires bootstrapping.<P>Anything that must be intrinsically known to the compiler is explicitlymarked.<P>Define as much as possible by the binding of names to values.<P>Use naming conventions in place of Common Lisp's multiple name-binding spacesfor functions, variables, types, and packages.<P>Discourage assignment, and make it syntactically obvious where it is allowedor occurs.  But do not forbid it.<P>Discourage unnecessary type declarations, but allow them where needed.<P>Use hygienic macros pervasively.<P>Language-enforced access control is incompatible with macros and withdebugging within the language, so do not attempt to provide that type offeature.  Use naming conventions and social enforcement instead.<P>Arithmetic operations must always produce mathematically correct results.No insanity like <TT>(x + y) / 2</TT> is sometimes a negative number when both <TT>x</TT>and <TT>y</TT> are positive.<P>Strive for programs to be readable yet concise.  Hence use infix syntax,case-insensitive names, and nesting structure indicated by indentationrather than punctuation.<P>Minimize the use of punctuation and maximize the use of whitespace, forreadability.<P>Avoid abbreviation, but when you must abbreviate, do it consistently.<P>Strive for simple concepts that combine in powerful ways.  Keep removingunnecessary complex features until no more can be removed.<P>Take full advantage of classes and methods.<P>Do not conflate the concepts of class, module, scope, and encapsulation.Use simple concepts that combine in powerful ways instead of one overlypowerful concept that tries to do everything.<P><P><BR><P align=center><A HREF="page-1.html">Previous page</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="index.html">Table of Contents</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="page-3.html">Next page</A></P><BR><br></body></html>
