The value of the operator is the value of the right-handside. If the right-hand side returns multiple values, the operator only usesand returns the first value.<P>If the left-hand side is a name, the name's definition in the current scopemust be assignable.  The definition's value is changed to the value of theright-hand side.  The macro's expansion is an assignment P-expression.<P>If the left-hand side is a slot-reference that reads a slot, the expansionis a slot-assignment that writes the same slot.<P>If the left-hand side is an invocation, the function being invoked must be aname.  The macro's expansion is an invocation of the corresponding setterfunction, whose name is the original function's name suffixed with ":=" andwhose context is the original function's context.  The setter function takesone additional argument, which is the right-hand side, and must return thevalue of that argument.  If the definition of the setter function is a macrorather than a function, the macro is expanded and the result is the expansionof the := macro.  In this case the syntax accepted by the macro must be thesyntax of a function call, with comma-separated arguments in parentheses.<P>Example:<PRE>f(x, y) := z</PRE>is equivalent to<PRE>f:=(x, y, z)</PRE><P><P><BR><P align=center><A HREF="page-29.html">Previous page</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="index.html">Table of Contents</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="page-31.html">Next page</A></P><BR><br></body></html>
