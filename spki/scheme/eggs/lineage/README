lineage - BSD line editing with history

A polished fork of linenoise for REPL applications.

Fixes over upstream linenoise:
  - Clear line before prompt (handles pre-displayed content)
  - lineage-with-initial for pre-populated edit buffer
  - Suppress spurious newline on empty input
  - Home/End cursor movement

API:
  (lineage prompt)                    Read line with prompt
  (lineage-with-initial prompt str)   Read with initial buffer content
  (history-add line)                  Add to history
  (set-history-length! n)             Set max history entries
  (save-history-to-file path)         Save history
  (load-history-from-file path)       Load history
  (make-lineage-port [prompt])        Create input port
