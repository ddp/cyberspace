Memo 0024: Key Ceremony Protocol


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Memo specifies key ceremony protocols for the Library of
Cyberspace: the ritualized generation, distribution, and activation of
cryptographic keys with witnessed verification. Key ceremonies establish
roots of trust through transparent, auditable, multi-party processes.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keys are the foundation of all cryptographic trust:

  * Generate wrong
  * Everything built on them fails
  * Store wrong
  * Compromise propagates everywhere
  * Distribute wrong
  * Man-in-the-middle forever
  * No witnesses
  * No one believes you did it right

Key generation errors are silent and total; unlike software bugs, they
produce no symptoms until catastrophic failure.

Key ceremonies solve this through:

  * Witnessed generation
  * Multiple parties verify randomness
  * Split custody
  * No single point of compromise
  * Documented process
  * Reproducible and auditable
  * Air-gapped execution
  * Network isolation during critical operations

Ceremony formalism converts trust from social obligation to
cryptographic proof; the record demonstrates correctness rather than
merely asserting it.

The Library requires key ceremonies for:

  * Vault master keys
  * Threshold signing keys
  * Root certificates
  * Recovery keys

These are the keys that cannot be rotated without significant
disruption; getting them right the first time is not optional.
