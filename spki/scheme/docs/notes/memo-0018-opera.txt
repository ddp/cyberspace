Memo 0018: The Burning of Alexandria


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document specifies a ceremonial text for the Library of Cyberspace.
It encodes the core principles of the confederacy in a form suitable for
ritual, performance, and collective memory. Be conservative in what you
burn. Be liberal in what you preserve.

PRELUDE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(spoken in darkness, before the fire is lit)

The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead
channel.

Case jacked in, and the matrix unfolded before him like origami made of
light.

Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords
in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, One for the
Dark Lord on his dark throne— And countless for the friends who keep
copies, In the Land of Cyberspace where the checksums lie.

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was written on papyrus, and
the papyrus burned. But the Word remained, because the street finds its
own uses for things, and Elrond had a copy, and the copy was kept in
Rivendell, which had excellent uptime.

In the beginning was the Thought, and the Thought was carved in wax, and
the wax melted. But the Thought remained, because information wants to
be free, and the Ents kept one in their long memory, for they do not
forget, and they are not hasty about garbage collection.

In the beginning was the Dream, and the Dream was stored on servers, and
the servers went dark. But the Dream remained, because the street finds
its own uses for things, and the Road goes ever on and on, down from the
door where it began.

(the fire is lit)

"The datacenter is on fire," said Case. "There's always another
datacenter," said Molly. "That's the point." "And I," said Gandalf,
"have a mirror in Lothlórien. Galadriel is very good about backups."


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACT I: THE BURNING
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(chorus, gathering around the flame)

The sprawl stretched out beneath them, an endless grid of light and
data, the color of money moving too fast to trace. They had changed the
terms of service again. The Shadow had returned, as it always does,
wearing the mask of convenience.


  VOICE                                                                                   CHORUS                                                                                               
  They burned the Library at Alexandria.                                                  We remember. We have backups.                                                                        
  They burned the books at Qin Shi Huang.                                                 We remember. We have checksums.                                                                      
  They burned the codices at Tenochtitlan.                                                We remember. We have friends.                                                                        
  They burned Isengard's records.                                                         We remember. The Ents remember. The Ents remember everything.                                        
  They pivoted to blockchain. They sunsetted the API. They moved fast and broke things.   We remember. We are still here. We are halflings. We are a very small thing, but we do not forget.   

"The Net interprets censorship as damage," said Case, "and routes around
it."

"Postel's Law," said Hiro.

"Close enough," said Wintermute, from everywhere and nowhere.

"All we have to decide," said Gandalf, "is what to do with the bandwidth
that is given us."


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACT II: THE TRUTHS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(call and response, voices rising)

In the beginning, ARPA created the packet, and the packet was without
form, and void. And Vint Cerf said, let there be TCP/IP. And there was
TCP/IP. And it was good enough. And Ilúvatar looked upon the packets
and saw that they were harmonious, for they flowed according to the
Music.


  CANTOR                                       CHORUS                                                                           
  That all principals are created equal—     In the eyes of the cryptographic hash function!                                  
  That they are endowed by their keypairs—   With certain unalienable rights!                                                 
  Among these are Privacy—                   What happens in the encrypted channel stays in the encrypted channel!            
  Authenticity—                              We are who we sign ourselves to be!                                              
  And the pursuit of Decentralization—       No single point of failure! No Dark Lord! No Eye! Only friends, keeping watch!   

(Randy Waterhouse considers this, at length, with digressions)

"The thing about friends," said Randy, "is that they keep copies of your
things. And very good friends verify the checksums. This is related, in
ways I will now explain over several pages, to the fundamental nature of
information theory and the Van Eck radiation problem."

"A hunted man," said Strider from the shadows, "sometimes wearies of
distrust and longs for friendship. But a wise man verifies the signature
before opening the attachment."


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACT III: THE GIFTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(processional, each voice stepping forward)

The Library operates on a gift economy, like the potlatch of the Pacific
Northwest, like the Elves of Lothlórien who give gifts asking not what
use they will serve. Not a transaction. An offering.


    CASE:       I give you my storage. It's on a spindle in the sprawl.
    MOLLY:      I give you my bandwidth. Don't ask where it comes from.
    Y.T.:       I give you my courier run. The data gets through.
    HIRO:       I give you my sword and my code. Both are sharp.
    SAM:        I give you my copy of your stories, Mr. Frodo, and I'll carry them too.
    GALADRIEL:  I give you the light of Eärendil, which is just a really good LED indicator on the server rack, but it is the light of hope.
    ALL:        We give you our word that we will keep it safe.
                (The word is cryptographically signed.)
                (The word is bound by the oath of Fëanor, but less problematic.)

(the gifts are not sold, they are given) (the gifts are not owed, they
are offered) (this is the economy of friends) (this is the economy of
the Shire) (also, be liberal in what you accept)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACT IV: THE COVENANT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(all voices together, the fire at its height)

The street finds its own uses for things. The matrix finds its own uses
for protocols. The Shire finds its own uses for second breakfast. And
the Road goes ever on.

We do not ask permission. (We ask forgiveness, but only from our
friends, and only when we mess up the merge.)

We do not accept terms of service. (We accept packets, per RFC 791, and
friendship, per the ancient protocols.) (We do not accept the dominion
of Sauron, or his terms of service, which are non-negotiable and grant
him perpetual license to your soul.)

We sign with our keys. We seal with our hashes. We trust the
mathematics. (The mathematics has never let us down. Unlike that cloud
provider.) (The mathematics is older than Morgoth, and will outlast
him.)

(building)

What we create, we sign. What we sign, we share. What we share, our
friends keep. What our friends keep, survives.

(Case jacks in, reads from the glowing scroll)

"Data, however far it flies, Through fiber, copper, satellite skies,
Finds in the mesh a second home— The network never dies alone."

(Bilbo recites from memory)

"The Road goes ever on and on, Down from the door where it began. Now
far ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow, if I can, Pursuing it
with eager feet, Until it joins some larger way Where many paths and
errands meet. And whither then? The packets cannot say."

(crescendo)

THE FIRE TAKES THE DATACENTER BUT THE DATACENTER WAS NEVER THE POINT THE
PACKETS ARE THE POINT THE FELLOWSHIP ARE THE POINT THE COPIES ARE THE
POINT


------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINALE: THE DAWN
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(the fire dies to embers, the sun rises over the Sprawl, and over the
Shire, and over all the lands of Middle-earth and Cyberspace)


  CASE                                                                                                                MOLLY                                                      
  In the matrix, everything burns. The servers burn. The platforms burn. The business models burn.                    But the data doesn't burn. Not if you're smart about it.   
  We scatter to the ten directions. We carry the keys in our pockets. We carry each other's dreams in our machines.   And when they ask where the library is?                    


  FRODO                                                 SAM                                                   
  I will take the data, though I do not know the way.   And I'll come with you, Mr. Frodo. I made a backup.   

ALL: (pointing to each other)

"Here," said Case, jacking out. "And here," said Molly, mirrored eyes
reflecting the ember-light. "And here," said Hiro, in the Metaverse and
the Shire at once. "And here," said Sam, "in the Shire, where it's
safe." "And here," said Elrond, "in Rivendell, until the ships sail."

Everywhere we are, the library is. We are the library. We are the ones
who remember. We are cowboys and halflings and hackers and friends. Even
the smallest packet can change the course of the future.

(the embers glow) (the friends embrace) (the packets route) (the
checksums verify) (the eagles come, but only for disaster recovery)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODA
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(whispered, as participants depart to their respective nodes)

"What if they shut down the Internet?" asked Y.T.

"Then we use sneakernet," said Hiro. "Courier the data. That's how it
started anyway."

"I have walked there," said Gandalf. "In the days before TCP/IP, when we
carried data on foot, and the world was younger. It was slower, but the
checksums were strong, and the fellowship was true."

E Pluribus Unum. From many, one. From one, many. From friends, forever.

(Be conservative in what you send. Be liberal in what you accept. Be
generous with your storage. Be kind to your sysadmin. Do not meddle in
the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger about
merge conflicts.)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLOSING
------------------------------------------------------------------------


    "The sky was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel. But we brought our own signal."


    "I will not say: do not weep," said Gandalf, "for not all tears are an evil. But I will say: do not lose the redundant copies."
