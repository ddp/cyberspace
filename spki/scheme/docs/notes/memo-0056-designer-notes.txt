NOTICE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a living document, not a specification. It records the
intellectual heritage, design philosophy, and collaborative process
behind Cyberspace.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTELLECTUAL HERITAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.1 MIT Athena and DSSA
-----------------------

Cyberspace traces its lineage to MIT's Athena project and the
Distributed System Security Architecture (DSSA) research that produced
SPKI.

Athena introduced Kerberos, distributed authentication, and the concept
of a unified computing environment across heterogeneous systems. DSSA,
led by Rivest, Lampson, and Ellison, gave us SPKI - capability-based
authorization through certificate chains.

These ideas were absorbed during the same lamport epoch as R4RS Scheme
(1991) and SDSI (1996), alongside the practical education of Boston
traffic negotiation - both exercises in asserting authority without
central coordination.


1.2 Why Scheme
--------------

Scheme was chosen not for nostalgia but for precision. Homoiconicity
makes S-expressions natural for both code and data - certificates, audit
records, and configuration are all readable by the same parser that
reads the implementation.

The language that Abelson and Sussman used to teach computational
thinking at MIT is the same language used to implement the security
architecture that MIT research defined. Full circle.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. COLLABORATIVE DESIGN
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cyberspace was designed in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic), an AI
assistant. This collaboration is documented in Memo-056.

The interaction model: human provides vision and constraints, AI
provides implementation and exploration. Neither could have built this
alone.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. TARGET ENVIRONMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Primary targets:

  * macOS (Apple Silicon) - Cyberspace.app native shell
  * Linux (x86_64) - including MIT Athena dialup
  * Any POSIX system with CHICKEN Scheme 5.x

The system should feel native on a Mac, work cleanly on Athena, and
build anywhere Scheme runs.
