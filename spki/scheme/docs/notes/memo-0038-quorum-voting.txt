Memo 0038: Quorum Protocol with Homomorphic Voting


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Memo specifies the quorum protocol for the Library of Cyberspace:
how principals reach collective decisions through homomorphic
encryption-based voting, enabling private ballot tallying without
revealing individual votes. Quorum integrates with threshold governance
(Memo-008) and Byzantine consensus (Memo-011).

MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collective decisions require:

  * Privacy
  * Voters shouldn't know how others voted
  * Verifiability
  * Results must be provably correct
  * Coercion resistance
  * Can't prove how you voted to others
  * Availability
  * Voting continues despite failures

Voting systems that sacrifice any of these properties enable
manipulation; true collective decision requires all four.

Traditional approaches fail:

  * Open ballot
  * No privacy, enables coercion
  * Trusted tallier
  * Single point of compromise
  * Secure multi-party computation
  * Complex, high communication overhead

Each failure mode represents a fundamental architectural limitation, not
merely an implementation weakness.

None of these approaches fits a decentralized, trustless environment.

Homomorphic encryption provides:

  * Vote on encrypted ballots
  * Sum without decryption
  * Decrypt only the final tally
  * Mathematical proof of correctness

Homomorphic encryption resolves the apparent paradox: computing on data
without seeing it.
