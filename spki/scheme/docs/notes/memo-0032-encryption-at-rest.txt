Memo 0032: Encryption at Rest


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Memo specifies encryption at rest for the Library of Cyberspace:
how vaults protect stored data using modern cryptography while
maintaining content-addressability, key management, and operational
flexibility. All sensitive data is encrypted before touching persistent
storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data at rest faces threats:

  * Physical theft
  * Disks, servers, backups stolen
  * Insider access
  * Unauthorized admin access
  * Legal compulsion
  * Forced disclosure orders
  * Decommissioning
  * Data remnants on old hardware

These threats exist regardless of how careful the operators are;
encryption transforms security from an operational problem to a
cryptographic one.

Encryption must be:

  * Transparent
  * Applications unaware of encryption
  * Performant
  * Minimal overhead
  * Recoverable
  * Key loss doesn't mean data loss
  * Auditable
  * All key operations logged

Encryption that applications must think about gets implemented
inconsistently; encryption that loses data on key loss is a liability.
