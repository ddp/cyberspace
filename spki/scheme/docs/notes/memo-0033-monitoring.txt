Memo 0033: Monitoring and Observability


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Memo specifies monitoring and observability for the Library of
Cyberspace: how vaults expose metrics, traces, and logs for operational
visibility while maintaining privacy and security. Observability data is
itself content-addressed and auditable.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operating distributed systems requires visibility:

  * Health
  * Is the vault functioning correctly?
  * Performance
  * How fast are operations?
  * Capacity
  * How much storage remains?
  * Errors
  * What's failing and why?
  * Security
  * Who's accessing what?

Without visibility, operators cannot distinguish working systems from
silently failing ones; observability is the difference between
confidence and hope.

But observability must not compromise:

  * Privacy
  * No sensitive data in metrics
  * Security
  * Metrics don't leak capabilities
  * Performance
  * Minimal overhead
  * Storage
  * Observability data is bounded

Monitoring systems that expose secrets or overwhelm the systems they
monitor are worse than no monitoring at all.
