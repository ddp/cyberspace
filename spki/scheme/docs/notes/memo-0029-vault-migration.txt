Memo 0029: Vault Migration


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Memo specifies vault migration for the Library of Cyberspace: how
to move vaults between hosts, storage backends, and administrative
domains while preserving content integrity, capability chains, and audit
continuity. Migration is essential for long-term preservation.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vaults must outlive their infrastructure:

  * Hardware failure
  * Disks die, servers decommission
  * Provider changes
  * Cloud vendors come and go
  * Jurisdiction
  * Legal requirements may force relocation
  * Performance
  * Move closer to users
  * Cost
  * Cheaper storage becomes available

Any archive that cannot outlive its current host is not truly an
archive; migration capability is survival capability.

Migration must be:

  * Complete
  * All objects, metadata, capabilities
  * Verifiable
  * Cryptographic proof of integrity
  * Resumable
  * Handle interruptions gracefully
  * Auditable
  * Full trail of what moved where

Incomplete or unverifiable migration is data loss with extra steps.
