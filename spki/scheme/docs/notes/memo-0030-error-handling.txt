Memo 0030: Error Handling and Recovery


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Memo specifies error handling and recovery for the Library of
Cyberspace: how vaults detect, report, and recover from failures while
maintaining integrity guarantees. Errors are first-class objects in the
soup, enabling systematic analysis and automated recovery.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributed systems fail in creative ways:

  * Network partitions
  * Vaults lose contact
  * Storage corruption
  * Bits flip, disks fail
  * Byzantine faults
  * Nodes lie or misbehave
  * Resource exhaustion
  * Out of memory, disk, connections
  * Protocol violations
  * Malformed messages, invalid state

These failure modes are not exceptional but routine; a distributed
system that does not plan for them is planning to fail.

Recovery must be:

  * Deterministic
  * Same error, same recovery
  * Auditable
  * Every error logged with context
  * Automatic
  * Self-healing where possible
  * Graceful
  * Degrade rather than crash

These requirements enable both automated recovery and post-mortem
analysis; systems that crash silently cannot be trusted or debugged.
