Memo 0036: Audit Log Protection


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Memo specifies protection mechanisms for the Library of Cyberspace
audit log: how the system prevents resource exhaustion, log flooding,
and denial of service attacks against the audit trail while maintaining
its integrity as the authoritative record of all vault operations.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The audit log is sacred:

  * Evidence
  * Legal and forensic record
  * Accountability
  * Who did what when
  * Recovery
  * Reconstruct state after failure
  * Trust
  * Foundation of the security model

The audit log is the ultimate source of truth; if it can be corrupted,
forged, or destroyed, no other security property holds.

But the audit log is also a target:

  * Flooding
  * Generate noise to hide malicious activity
  * Exhaustion
  * Fill storage to halt operations
  * Evasion
  * Overwhelm to prevent logging of real attacks
  * Amplification
  * Small action triggers large log entries

Each attack vector weaponizes the log's own integrity requirements
against itself.

The attacker knows that disrupting the log disrupts accountability.

The audit log must protect itself while never failing to record.
