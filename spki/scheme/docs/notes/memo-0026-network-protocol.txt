Memo 0026: Network Protocol


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Memo specifies the network protocol for the Library of Cyberspace:
how vaults discover each other, authenticate, exchange objects, and
synchronize state. The protocol is transport-agnostic,
capability-authenticated, and optimized for content-addressed data.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vaults must communicate to:

  * Replicate
  * Distribute objects across vaults
  * Federate
  * Link independent vaults into networks
  * Subscribe
  * Receive updates from publishers
  * Query
  * Search the distributed soup

Without network communication, vaults are isolated archives; with it,
they form a distributed library.

The protocol must handle:

  * Intermittent connectivity
  * Vaults may be offline
  * Untrusted networks
  * All communication authenticated
  * Large objects
  * Efficient chunked transfer
  * Partial sync
  * Resume interrupted transfers

These constraints reflect the reality of distributed systems: the
network is hostile, connections are ephemeral, and transfers fail
midway.
