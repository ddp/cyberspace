<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This Memo defines functional roles for nodes in a Library of Cyberspace confederation based on compute, storage, network, and security capabilities. Roles determine what operations a node can perform and how it participates in the distributed system.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>Realm: A node's place in cyberspace. A realm encompasses: - The node's vault (local content-addressed object store) - The node's principal (Ed25519 identity) - The node's capabilities (hardware, network, security) - The node's objects (what it stores and serves)</p>
<p>A realm is local-first and sovereign. The node controls what to share, who to trust, what to replicate. When nodes federate, their realms overlap - objects flow between them according to trust relationships.</p>
<p>The hardware manifest stored at .vault/node-hardware declares what kind of place this realm occupies in cyberspace.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Memo-010 (Federation Protocol) defines trust relationships between peers (publisher, subscriber, peer). However, it does not address functional capabilities - what operations each node can actually perform based on its hardware and network constraints.</p>
<p>A Raspberry Pi on a solar-powered satellite uplink has different capabilities than a rack-mounted server in a datacenter. The system should:</p>
<p>1. Self-assess - Nodes should know their own capabilities 2. Declare - Nodes should advertise their role to peers 3. Adapt - Operations should degrade gracefully based on available roles 4. Persist - Role assignments should survive restarts</p>
