Memo 0025: Demonic Agents


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Memo specifies demonic agents for the Library of Cyberspace: how
autonomous agents—daemons in the BSD tradition—are spawned,
constrained, monitored, and terminated. Agents are helpful spirits that
operate with capability-based authority in isolated sandboxes, enabling
safe delegation of tasks while maintaining security boundaries. The
vault daemons watch over all.

MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------


The BSD Daemon Tradition
------------------------

In Unix mythology, a daemon is a helpful spirit—a background process
that tends to the system without being asked. The term comes from
Maxwell's demon, the thought experiment about a creature that sorts
molecules. BSD gave this concept a face: Beastie, the cheerful daemon
with a pitchfork, watching over the system.

The Library embraces this tradition. Our agents are daemons—helpful
spirits that carry authority, travel between vaults, and do work while
their principals sleep.


The General Magic Vision
------------------------

Telescript, from 1994:


    "Programs that travel from machine to machine, carrying your authority, doing things while you sleep."

That vision failed because:

  * No security model
  * Agents ran with ambient authority
  * No isolation
  * One agent could corrupt another
  * No accountability
  * No audit of agent actions
  * No revocation
  * Once launched, agents were uncontrollable

Telescript's failure was not technical but architectural: mobile code
without capability discipline is indistinguishable from malware.
