<h1>Memo 0046: Realm Keystore and Attestation</h1>
<dl class="metadata">
</dl>
<hr>
<section>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A realm without identity is not sovereign. This Memo defines two protected stores within the vault:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keystore - where cryptographic identity lives (Ed25519 signing keys)</li>
<li>Attestation Store - where proofs about the realm live (hardware, software, identity claims)</li>
</ul>
<p>Together they form the inner vault - the protected core of a realm. Keys prove who you are. Attestations prove what you are.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Memo-040 established that capabilities flow from Ed25519 signatures. Every certificate, every sealed release, every audit entry requires a signature. But where does the signing key live?</p>
<p>Currently: ephemeral, generated per session. This is fine for testing but broken for production. A realm needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent identity - the same principal across sessions</li>
<li>Protected storage - keys encrypted at rest</li>
<li>Recovery path - don't lose your realm to a forgotten passphrase</li>
<li>Rotation support - keys age, compromise happens</li>
</ul>
<p>A realm without persistent identity cannot accumulate trust, cannot be referenced by peers, and loses all context on restart. The keystore provides the cryptographic continuity that makes realm sovereignty meaningful.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Realm Continuity</h2>
<p>A realm is not a snapshot. It accumulates.</p>
<p>Identity continuity - Your principal persists across sessions, machines, years. Key rotation creates a signed chain: each new key vouched for by the old. The chain IS your history.</p>
<p>Context accumulation - Every capability granted, every object stored, every federation established - these form the realm's memory. The audit chain records what happened. The attestation store proves what you were at each moment.</p>
<p>History matters - A realm that has existed for ten years, rotated keys three times, accumulated thousands of attestations, federated with hundreds of peers - this realm has weight. Trust accrues. Reputation emerges from the chain.</p>

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
</pre>
<p>The inner vault preserves this continuity: - Keystore - the chain of identity - Attestations - the record of what you were - Audit - the log of what you did</p>
<p>A realm without history is newborn. A realm with history has standing.</p>
<h3>The Sealed Closure</h3>
<p>A realm is a sealed closure - it closes over its environment and that closure is cryptographically bound.</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
;; The realm as closure
(lambda (request)
  ;; Closed over:
  ;;   - genesis: the first key, the origin moment
  ;;   - keychain: every rotation, signed by predecessor
  ;;   - attestations: every proof of what we were
  ;;   - audit: every action taken
  ;;   - capabilities: every right we hold
  ;;   - objects: every thing we store
  ;;
  ;; The closure is sealed:
  ;;   - Hash-chained: tamper-evident
  ;;   - Signed: non-repudiable
  ;;   - Content-addressed: self-verifying
  ;;
  (verify-and-respond request))
</pre>
<p>You cannot forge a realm. You cannot inject false history. You cannot claim attestations you don't have. The closure is sealed at every point - verify any moment, the chain holds or it doesn't.</p>
<p>Import a realm? You import the entire closure - genesis to present.</p>
<p>Fork a realm? You create a new closure that references the old. The fork point is signed.</p>
<p>Merge realms? The histories must be compatible. Conflicts are visible.</p>
<p>The sealed closure is the unit of trust in cyberspace.</p>
<h3>Living in the Soup</h3>
<p>The sealed closure doesn't exist in a vacuum - it lives in the soup.</p>
<p>The soup is the medium. Objects float in it - content-addressed, immutable, queryable. The realm swims through the soup, accumulating objects, granting capabilities, leaving audit trails. Everything the realm touches becomes part of its context.</p>

│   Objects float. The realm is sovereign territory.              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
</pre>
<p>The realm is an island in the soup - an enclave of sovereignty, an instance you can address. Objects float past, currents of content flow through cyberspace, but the island is bounded. Its shores are defined by capabilities: what it can see, what it can grant, what attests to it.</p>
<p>Every realm has coordinates: its principal. ed25519:7f3a2b4c... isn't just an identifier - it's a place you can teleport to. Present the right capability, and you're there. The soup connects all islands; the principal is your destination.</p>
<p>Or send an agent.</p>
<p>You needn't go yourself. Delegate a capability to an agent - a subprocess, a daemon, a trusted emissary - and it travels on your behalf. The agent carries your authority (attenuated, scoped, time-limited) and acts in the soup. It visits realms, fetches objects, negotiates federation. When it returns, its audit trail merges with yours.</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(delegate-agent
  (parent "ed25519:your-realm...")
  (agent "ed25519:agent-key...")
  (capabilities
    (read "sha512:*")              ; Can read any object
    (federate "ed25519:peer..."))  ; Can negotiate with this peer
  (valid (not-after 1736500000))   ; Expires in 24h
  (sandbox                          ; Constraints
    (no-propagate)                  ; Cannot delegate further
    (audit-required)))              ; Must return audit chain
</pre>
<p>The agent is a sealed closure too - spawned from yours, carrying delegated authority, accumulating its own history. When the mission ends, the histories merge or the agent is revoked.</p>
<p>Lineage:</p>
<p>Go yourself - like telnet or VMS SET HOST. You're there, synchronous, your session on that node. Direct presence in another realm.</p>
<p>Send an agent - like General Magic's Magic Cap and Telescript. Autonomous travelers carrying your intent, visiting places, doing work, returning with results. But recast in the spirit of Newton - agents swim in the soup, query objects, accumulate context. The soup is their medium, capabilities their passport.</p>
<p>The soup is a wilderness of mirrors. Objects reference objects. Hashes point to hashes. Capabilities chain through delegation. Attestations vouch for attestations. An agent navigating the soup sees reflections within reflections - content-addressed identity means every object is its own mirror. The agent must hold the thread of its capability chain or be lost in infinite regress.</p>
<p>This is not a safe place. It's cyberspace.</p>

                    THE SOUP
                 (Newton's medium)
</pre>
<p>Objects have no access control - they're just content, identified by hash. The realm closure holds the capabilities that give meaning: "I can read this," "I granted that," "This attests to me."</p>
<p>The soup is shared. Islands may be near or far. Federation is building bridges between islands - agreeing to share objects, honor capabilities, witness each other's audit chains.</p>
<h3>Addressing Objects</h3>
<p>Objects in cyberspace have coordinates:</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
;; Local (this realm)
"releases/1.0.3"                    ; By path
"sha512:abc123..."                  ; By hash

;; Remote (another realm) - @ syntax
"@ed25519:7f3a2b.../releases/1.0.3"     ; Named object at realm
"@ed25519:7f3a2b.../sha512:abc123..."   ; Hash-addressed at realm

;; With role context - @principal+role:/path
"@ed25519:7f3a2b...+curator:/collections/rare-books"
"@ed25519:7f3a2b...+guardian:/vault/keys"
"@ed25519:7f3a2b...+witness:/audit/signatures"

;; With explicit capabilities - @principal+{caps}:/path
"@ed25519:7f3a2b...+{read}:/objects/sha512:abc..."
"@ed25519:7f3a2b...+{read,write}:/collections/working"
"@ed25519:7f3a2b...+{read,delegate(read)}:/shared/docs"

;; Role with capability refinement
"@ed25519:7f3a2b...+curator{read}:/collections/rare-books"  ; curator, read only

;; Inspect remote sealed object
(soup-inspect "@ed25519:7f3a2b.../releases/1.0.3")

;; Fetch requires capability
(soup-fetch "@ed25519:7f3a2b.../sha512:abc123..."
  capability: my-read-cert)

;; Fetch with role context
(soup-fetch "@ed25519:7f3a2b...+curator:/collections/rare-books"
  capability: my-curator-cert)
</pre>
<p>The @principal:/path syntax reads: "at this realm, this object." The principal is your teleport destination. The path or hash is what you're looking for.</p>
<p>The @principal+role:/path syntax adds role context: "at this realm, acting as this role, this object."</p>
<p>The @principal+{caps}:/path syntax specifies explicit capabilities: "at this realm, with these specific capabilities, this object." Roles are shorthand for capability bundles; the +{caps} form is the truth underneath.</p>
<p>+role{caps} combines both: use this role, but only these capabilities from it. Principle of least authority - request only what you need.</p>
<p>Without a capability granting access, you can see the object exists (if the realm publishes its bloom filter) but cannot fetch its contents. The wilderness of mirrors shows reflections - but you need the right key to step through.</p>

<h2>Cryptographic Operations</h2>
<h3>Key Derivation</h3>
<p>Passphrase → encryption key via Argon2id:</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(define (derive-key passphrase salt)
  "Derive encryption key from passphrase using Argon2id"
  (let ((key (make-blob 32)))
    (sodium-pwhash!
      key
      passphrase
      salt
      3                          ; ops-limit (moderate)
      268435456                  ; mem-limit (256 MB)
      'argon2id)
    key))
</pre>
<p>Why Argon2id: - Memory-hard: resists GPU/ASIC attacks - Time-hard: configurable iterations - Side-channel resistant: hybrid of Argon2i and Argon2d - Winner of Password Hashing Competition - Already in libsodium</p>
<h3>Encryption</h3>
<p>Private key encrypted via XChaCha20-Poly1305:</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(define (encrypt-private-key private-key encryption-key)
  "Encrypt private key for storage"
  (let ((nonce (random-bytes 24)))
    (values
      nonce
      (sodium-secretbox private-key nonce encryption-key))))

(define (decrypt-private-key ciphertext nonce encryption-key)
  "Decrypt private key from storage"
  (sodium-secretbox-open ciphertext nonce encryption-key))
</pre>
<p>Why XChaCha20-Poly1305: - 256-bit key, 192-bit nonce - Extended nonce allows random generation (no counter needed) - Authenticated: tampering detected - Fast in software - Already in libsodium (crypto_secretbox)</p>

<h2>Attestation Store</h2>
<p>Attestations are signed claims about the realm. They answer: "What can you prove about yourself?"</p>
<h3>Attestation Types</h3>
<p>Hardware Attestations - proofs from silicon:</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(hardware-attestation
  (type "anchor-quote")
  (timestamp 1736400000)
  (platform "Darwin-arm64")

    (rune-boot #${boot-measurement...})
    (rune-policy #${secureboot-policy...}))
  (signature #${anchor-signature...})
  (certificate #${endorsement-key-cert...}))

<p>Software Attestations - proofs from code:</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">

  (issuer "ed25519:ca-public-key...")     ; Vouching authority
  (claims
    (organization "Acme Corp")
    (role "coordinator"))
  (valid (not-after 1767936000))
  (signature #${ca-signature...}))
</pre>
<p>Capability Attestations - proof of holding:</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(capability-attestation
  (type "capability-proof")
  (timestamp 1736400000)
  (capability "sha512:cert-hash...")

  (challenge #${nonce...})                ; Prevents replay
  (response #${signed-challenge...}))
</pre>
<h3>Attestation Catalog</h3>
<p>The attestation store maintains a catalog for fast lookup:</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(attestations-meta
  (version 1)
  (count 5)
  (types
    (hardware 2)
    (software 1)
    (identity 1)
    (capability 1))
  (latest-refresh 1736400000)
  (entries

    ((id "att-002") (type hardware) (file "hardware/secure-enclave.att") (expires #f))
    ((id "att-003") (type software) (file "software/runtime-hash.att") (expires #f))
    ((id "att-004") (type identity) (file "identity/ca-cert.att") (expires 1767936000))
    ((id "att-005") (type capability) (file "capability/coord-role.att") (expires 1736500000))))

;; =&gt; (hardware-attestation (type "anchor-quote") ...)
</pre>
<h3>Attestation Chain</h3>
<p>Attestations can chain - a hardware attestation vouches for software, software vouches for capabilities:</p>
<pre class="diagram">
┌───────────────────────────┐
│    The Anchor (Silicon)   │  "This boot sequence is measured"
└─────────────┬─────────────┘
              │ vouches for
              ▼
┌───────────────────────────┐
│    Software Runes         │  "These binaries are running"
└─────────────┬─────────────┘
              │ vouches for
              ▼
┌───────────────────────────┐
│    Realm Identity         │  "This is my signing key"
└─────────────┬─────────────┘
              │ vouches for
              ▼
┌───────────────────────────┐
│    Capabilities Held      │  "I can do these things"
└───────────────────────────┘
</pre>
<p>Remote verifier can walk the chain: "Show me your hardware attestation, software measurement, and the capability you claim."</p>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p>Coordinator Election (Memo-037): Candidate presents attestations proving hardware capability and identity. Voters verify before granting coordinator role.</p>
<p>Federation Trust (Memo-039): Realms exchange attestations when federating. "Before I sync objects with you, prove your software is legitimate."</p>
<p>High-Security Operations: Some capabilities might require fresh attestation: "This capability requires Anchor attestation less than 1 hour old."</p>

<h2>Hardware Token Support</h2>
<p>Future: YubiKey, secure enclaves, hardware anchors.</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(keystore-meta
  (version 1)
  (protection "hardware")
  (hardware-type "yubikey-5")
  (hardware-serial "12345678")
  (public-key #${...}))          ; Private key never leaves device
</pre>
<p>The private key never touches disk - it lives in the hardware token. Operations requiring signature prompt for touch.</p>

<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
<h3>What We Protect Against</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Threat </th><th>Mitigation </th></tr>
<tr><td>Disk theft </td><td>Encrypted at rest (XChaCha20-Poly1305) </td></tr>
<tr><td>Weak passphrase </td><td>Argon2id memory-hard KDF </td></tr>
<tr><td>Brute force </td><td>Rate limiting, attempt counter </td></tr>
<tr><td>Memory dump </td><td>Zero memory after use </td></tr>
<tr><td>Forgotten passphrase </td><td>Threshold recovery shares </td></tr>
<tr><td>Key compromise </td><td>Rotation support </td></tr>
</table>
<h3>What We Don't Protect Against</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Threat </th><th>Why </th></tr>
<tr><td>Compromised endpoint </td><td>If attacker has root, game over </td></tr>
<tr><td>Keylogger capturing passphrase </td><td>Endpoint security problem </td></tr>
<tr><td>Rubber hose cryptanalysis </td><td>Math doesn't help </td></tr>
<tr><td>Quantum computers </td><td>Ed25519 vulnerable (migration planned) </td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Memory Handling</h3>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(define (with-sensitive-data data thunk)
  "Execute thunk with sensitive data, zero on exit"
  (dynamic-wind
    (lambda () #f)
    thunk
    (lambda () (sodium-memzero! data))))
</pre>
<p>Private keys are zeroed immediately after use. Passphrases are zeroed after key derivation.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>REPL Commands</h2>
<pre class="language-scheme">
;; Check keystore status
(keystore-status)
;; =&gt; (keystore (status unlocked) (principal "ed25519:7f3a...") (protection passphrase))

;; Lock keystore (zero keys from memory)
(keystore-lock)
;; =&gt; Keystore locked. Re-authentication required for signing.

;; Unlock keystore
(keystore-unlock)
;; =&gt; Passphrase: 
;; =&gt; Keystore unlocked.

;; Change passphrase
(keystore-change-passphrase)
;; =&gt; Current passphrase: 
;; =&gt; New passphrase: 
;; =&gt; Confirm: 
;; =&gt; Passphrase changed.

;; Create recovery shares
(keystore-backup threshold: 2 shares: 3)

;; Recover from shares
(keystore-recover share1 share2)

;; Rotate key
(keystore-rotate)

;; Export public key (safe to share)
(keystore-export-public)
;; =&gt; (realm-public-key (algorithm "ed25519") (public-key #${7f3a...}))

<h2>Vault Protection</h2>
<p>The keystore protects itself. The operating system is not trusted.</p>
<p>realm.key - Never stored plaintext. The ciphertext blob is meaningless without the passphrase. Even if someone copies the file, they have nothing.</p>
<p>realm.pub - Public by nature. This IS your identity. Share it freely.</p>
<p>attestations/ - Signed claims. Tamper-evident by construction. Copy them, share them - forgery is computationally infeasible.</p>
<p>The vault doesn't rely on filesystem permissions, SELinux, or any operating system mechanism. Cyberspace assumes the OS is compromised. Protection comes from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encryption - Private key encrypted at rest</li>
<li>Memory zeroing - Keys cleared immediately after use</li>
<li>Signatures - Everything signed, tampering detected</li>
<li>Content addressing - Hash IS identity</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone has root on your machine, they can install a keylogger - that's a physical security problem, not a cryptographic one. Cyberspace protects the math. Protect the machine yourself.</p>

<h2>Integration</h2>
<h3>With seal-release (Memo-033)</h3>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(seal-release "1.0.4" name: "phoenix")
;; Uses keystore signing key automatically
;; Prompts for unlock if keystore locked
</pre>
<h3>With capabilities (Memo-004)</h3>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(spki-cert-create
  subject: "ed25519:bob..."
  tag: '(read "sha512:doc..."))
;; Signed with keystore key
;; Issuer automatically set to realm principal
</pre>
<h3>With audit (Memo-040)</h3>
<pre class="language-scheme">
;; Audit entries signed with keystore key
;; Principal identity consistent across sessions
</pre>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Invariants</h2>
<h3>Keystore</h3>
<pre class="diagram">
K1. Private key never stored plaintext
    stored(private-key) → encrypted(private-key)

K2. Decryption requires authentication
    decrypt(keystore) → auth(passphrase) ∨ auth(hardware) ∨ auth(threshold)

K3. Memory zeroed after use
    use(sensitive-data) → zero(sensitive-data)

K4. Rotation preserves identity chain
    rotate(k₁,k₂) → signed(k₂, k₁)

K5. Recovery requires threshold
    recover(keystore) → shares ≥ k
</pre>
<h3>Attestation</h3>
<pre class="diagram">
A1. Attestations are signed
    store(attestation) → signed(attestation, issuer)

A2. Attestation chains are verifiable
    chain(a₁→a₂→...→aₙ) → ∀i: valid_sig(aᵢ)

A3. Hardware attestations originate from anchors
    hardware-attestation(a) → anchor-signed(a)

A4. Attestations are timestamped
    attestation(a) → timestamp(a) ∧ fresh(a, policy)

A5. Expired attestations are invalid
    expired(a) → ¬valid(a)
</pre>

<section>
<h2>Quantum Resistance</h2>
<p>SHA-512 won't survive. Grover's algorithm halves the security - 256 bits becomes 128. For the wilderness of mirrors to endure, we need quantum-resistant Merkle trees.</p>
<p>The Path Forward:</p>
<pre class="diagram">
Current:     sha512(content) → object identity
Future:      merkle-root(shake256(chunks...)) → object identity
</pre>
<p>Why Merkle trees: - Incremental updates without rehashing everything - Selective disclosure - prove a branch without revealing siblings - Tree structure means log(n) proof sizes - Quantum-resistant hash at each node</p>
<p>Candidate hash functions:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Function </th><th>Output </th><th>Notes </th></tr>
<tr><td>SHAKE256 </td><td>Variable </td><td>SHA-3 family, NIST approved, used by SPHINCS+ </td></tr>
<tr><td>BLAKE3 </td><td>256-bit </td><td>Fast, tree-based internally, modern </td></tr>
<tr><td>SHA-3-512 </td><td>512-bit </td><td>Conservative choice, different construction than SHA-2 </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Migration:</p>
<p>Objects can carry both hashes during transition:</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(object
  (content-hash "sha512:abc123...")           ; Legacy
  (merkle-root "shake256:def456...")          ; Quantum-resistant
  (tree-depth 4)
  (chunk-size 4096))
</pre>
<p>The soup becomes a forest of Merkle trees. Each object a tree, each tree quantum-hardened. The wilderness of mirrors, built to outlast the quantum winter.</p>
<p>Ed25519 replacement: SPHINCS+ or CRYSTALS-Dilithium for signatures. That's a separate RFC.</p>
