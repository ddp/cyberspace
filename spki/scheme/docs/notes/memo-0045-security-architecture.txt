Memo 0045: Security Architecture


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document defines how cyberspace protects itself. The model is
simple: capabilities all the way down. Objects are content.
Authorization flows through signed certificates. No labels, no ACLs, no
ambient authority. You hold a capability or you don't.

We use the rigor of TCSEC B2 as a lens - particularly for covert channel
analysis - but cyberspace is its own thing. This is our security
architecture, in our language.

THE MANIFESTO
------------------------------------------------------------------------


    "Authorized capability set with auditing. No central authority."

You can have a central authority if you want one. That's up to you. But
you don't need one. The architecture doesn't require it. Trust flows
from keys you choose to trust, not from a hierarchy imposed upon you.

These principles were proven in VAXcluster security (1984-1994),
proposed in SDSI at IETF 29 Seattle (1994), and implemented partially in
products that didn't survive their parent companies. Cyberspace
completes what was started.

  1984   VAXcluster   "Behave as one" - N nodes, one security domain                          
  1985   VMS C2       Audit trails, access control, TCSEC security primitives                 
  1990   DigiCash     Blind signatures, unlinkable credentials (Chaum)                        
  1993   VMS 6.0      Cluster-wide intrusion detection, TLV object store                      
  1994   SDSI         Self-certifying keys, local names (Rivest, IETF 29)                     
  1999   SPKI         Authorization certificates, capability delegation (Ellison, RFC 2693)   
  2026   NSA ZIG      Zero Trust Implementation Guidelines: never trust, always verify        
  2026   Cyberspace   Synthesis: SPKI + Chaum + audit + IPv6 mesh + no central authority      

DECnet Phase IV had 24-bit addressing—fatal for internet scale.
Cyberspace is designed for IPv6: 128-bit addresses, global mesh, same
security principles.

The NSA Zero Trust framework (January 2026) independently validates the
capability approach. Their seven pillars—User, Device, Network,
Application, Data, Visibility, Automation—map directly to our
architecture: identity via SPKI principals, device attestation
(Memo-046), capability-constrained routing, per-operation authorization.
"Never trust, always verify" is axiom A1 restated. "Assume breach" is
why we use content-addressing and cryptographic binding rather than
perimeter trust.
