Memo 0039: Realm Roles and Capabilities


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Memo defines functional roles for nodes in a Library of Cyberspace
confederation based on compute, storage, network, and security
capabilities. Roles determine what operations a node can perform and how
it participates in the distributed system.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
TERMINOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Realm: A node's place in cyberspace. A realm encompasses: - The node's
vault (local content-addressed object store) - The node's principal
(Ed25519 identity) - The node's capabilities (hardware, network,
security) - The node's objects (what it stores and serves)

A realm is local-first and sovereign. The node controls what to share,
who to trust, what to replicate. When nodes federate, their realms
overlap - objects flow between them according to trust relationships.

The hardware manifest stored at .vault/node-hardware declares what kind
of place this realm occupies in cyberspace.

MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memo-010 (Federation Protocol) defines trust relationships between peers
(publisher, subscriber, peer). However, it does not address functional
capabilities - what operations each node can actually perform based on
its hardware and network constraints.

A Raspberry Pi on a solar-powered satellite uplink has different
capabilities than a rack-mounted server in a datacenter. The system
should:

  * Self-assess - Nodes should know their own capabilities
  * Declare - Nodes should advertise their role to peers
  * Adapt - Operations should degrade gracefully based on available roles
  * Persist - Role assignments should survive restarts

Automatic role detection enables heterogeneous hardware to participate
appropriately without manual configuration.

Without explicit role management, the system either assumes all nodes
are equal or requires manual configuration; neither scales.
