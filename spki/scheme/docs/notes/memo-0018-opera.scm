  (title "The Burning of Alexandria")
  (section
    "Abstract"
    (p "This document specifies a ceremonial text for the Library of Cyberspace. It encodes the core principles of the confederacy in a form suitable for ritual, performance, and collective memory. Be conservative in what you burn. Be liberal in what you preserve."))

    "Status"
    (p "CULTURAL / FOUNDATIONAL"))
  (section
    "PRELUDE"
    (p "(spoken in darkness, before the fire is lit)")
    (p "The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.")
    (p "Case jacked in, and the matrix unfolded before him like origami made of light.")
    (p "Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne— And countless for the friends who keep copies, In the Land of Cyberspace where the checksums lie.")
    (p "        In the beginning was the Word,         and the Word was written on papyrus,         and the papyrus burned.         But the Word remained, because the street finds its own uses for things,         and Elrond had a copy,         and the copy was kept in Rivendell,         which had excellent uptime.")
    (p "        In the beginning was the Thought,         and the Thought was carved in wax,         and the wax melted.         But the Thought remained, because information wants to be free,         and the Ents kept one in their long memory,         for they do not forget, and they are not hasty about garbage collection.")
    (p "        In the beginning was the Dream,         and the Dream was stored on servers,         and the servers went dark.         But the Dream remained, because the street finds its own uses for things,         and the Road goes ever on and on,         down from the door where it began.")
    (p "(the fire is lit)")
    (p "        \"The datacenter is on fire,\" said Case.         \"There's always another datacenter,\" said Molly. \"That's the point.\"         \"And I,\" said Gandalf, \"have a mirror in Lothlórien. Galadriel is very good about backups.\""))
  (section
    "ACT I: THE BURNING"
    (p "(chorus, gathering around the flame)")
    (p "The sprawl stretched out beneath them, an endless grid of light and data, the color of money moving too fast to trace. They had changed the terms of service again. The Shadow had returned, as it always does, wearing the mask of convenience.")

      (row "They pivoted to blockchain. They sunsetted the API. They moved fast and broke things. " "We remember. We are still here. We are halflings. We are a very small thing, but we do not forget. "))
    (p "\"The Net interprets censorship as damage,\" said Case, \"and routes around it.\"")
    (p "\"Postel's Law,\" said Hiro.")
    (p "\"Close enough,\" said Wintermute, from everywhere and nowhere.")
    (p "\"All we have to decide,\" said Gandalf, \"is what to do with the bandwidth that is given us.\""))
  (section
    "ACT II: THE TRUTHS"
    (p "(call and response, voices rising)")
    (p "In the beginning, ARPA created the packet, and the packet was without form, and void. And Vint Cerf said, let there be TCP/IP. And there was TCP/IP. And it was good enough. And Ilúvatar looked upon the packets and saw that they were harmonious, for they flowed according to the Music.")

    (p "(Randy Waterhouse considers this, at length, with digressions)")
    (p "\"The thing about friends,\" said Randy, \"is that they keep copies of your things. And very good friends verify the checksums. This is related, in ways I will now explain over several pages, to the fundamental nature of information theory and the Van Eck radiation problem.\"")
    (p "\"A hunted man,\" said Strider from the shadows, \"sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship. But a wise man verifies the signature before opening the attachment.\""))
  (section
    "ACT III: THE GIFTS"
    (p "(processional, each voice stepping forward)")
    (p "The Library operates on a gift economy, like the potlatch of the Pacific Northwest, like the Elves of Lothlórien who give gifts asking not what use they will serve. Not a transaction. An offering.")

The data gets through.\nHIRO:       I give you my sword and my code. Both are sharp.\nSAM:        I give you my copy of your stories, Mr. Frodo, and I'll carry them too.\nGALADRIEL:  I give you the light of Eärendil, which is just a really good LED indicator on the server rack, but it is the light of hope.\nALL:        We give you our word that we will keep it safe.\n            (The word is cryptographically signed.)\n            (The word is bound by the oath of Fëanor, but less problematic.)")

    (p "        We do not accept terms of service.         (We accept packets, per RFC 791, and friendship, per the ancient protocols.)         (We do not accept the dominion of Sauron, or his terms of service, which are non-negotiable and grant him perpetual license to your soul.)")
    (p "        We sign with our keys.         We seal with our hashes.         We trust the mathematics.         (The mathematics has never let us down. Unlike that cloud provider.)         (The mathematics is older than Morgoth, and will outlast him.)")

Now far ahead the Road has gone,          And I must follow, if I can,          Pursuing it with eager feet,          Until it joins some larger way          Where many paths and errands meet.          And whither then? The packets cannot say.\"")
