Memo 0000: Declaration of Cyberspace

PREAMBLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When in the course of computational events, it becomes necessary for one
system to dissolve the centralized bonds which have connected it with
another, and to assume among the powers of the network, the separate and
equal station to which the Laws of Mathematics and of Cryptography
entitle it, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that it
should declare the causes which impel it to the separation.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELF-EVIDENT TRUTHS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We hold these truths to be self-evident:

  * That all principals are created equal in the eyes of cryptography
  * That they are endowed by their keys with certain unalienable Rights
  * That among these are Privacy, Authenticity, and the pursuit of Decentralization
  * That to secure these rights, Protocols are instituted among Nodes, deriving their just powers from the consent of the participants
  * That whenever any Form of Architecture becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Systems


------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECLARATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We, therefore, the Representatives of the Library of Cyberspace,
assembled in loose confederation, appealing to the Supreme Judge of
Mathematics for the rectitude of our intentions, do solemnly publish and
declare:

That these united Specifications are, and of Right ought to be, Free and
Independent Protocols; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to
Central Authority, and that all political connection between them and
any single point of failure, is and ought to be totally dissolved.

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the
protection of Cryptographic Providence, we mutually pledge to each other
our Keys, our Signatures, and our sacred Honor.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE PRIME DIRECTIVE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uniform abstractions. No special cases. Composition over complexity.

This is the shape that systems take when they are allowed to find their
natural form. Plan 9 found it in files. Lisp found it in S-expressions.
Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI) found it in capabilities. We
find it in the soup.

The language is incidental. The shape is inevitable.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The foundational specifications, ordered by dependency from primitive to
composite:


  №  Memo                      Commandment                                 
  0    Declaration               Thou shalt have no central authority        
  1    Conventions               Thou shalt document in S-expressions        
  2    Architecture              Thou shalt know thy vision                  
  3    Public Key Authorization  Thou shalt let keys be principals           
  4    Shamir Sharing            Thou shalt have no single point of failure  
  5    Audit Trail               Thou shalt witness all actions              
  6    Vault Architecture        Thou shalt address content by truth         
  7    Replication Layer         Thou shalt federate thy distribution        
  8    Threshold Governance      Thou shalt seek consensus over dictators    
  9    Designer Notes            Thou shalt know why it was ordained         

These ten form the core of the Library. All other memos build upon them.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This declaration stands on the shoulders of giants:

  * The Grateful Dead, who understood that sharing creates more value than hoarding, and whose tape-trading gift economy prefigured the commons
  * John Perry Barlow, Dead lyricist and cyberspace prophet, whose 1996 Declaration of Independence lit the way
  * Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the declaration of human liberty in language that still echoes
  * Alexander Hamilton, who designed federation—sovereignty with union—in the Federalist Papers
  * Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, who showed in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs that from a few primitives, you can build everything
  * Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who gave us public key cryptography and proved that strangers could share secrets
  * Ralph Merkle, who gave us trees of hashes and showed that authentication could scale
  * Ron Rivest, who gave us RSA, SDSI, and the insight that names should be self-certifying
  * Hugo Krawczyk, who gave us HKDF and proved that key derivation could be rigorous
  * Ran Canetti, who gave us Universal Composability and showed how to reason about security under composition

The language is incidental. The shape is inevitable.

E Pluribus Unum

Signed under cryptographic seal:


    @ddp+{sign,delegate}:/declarations/cyberspace/000
      realm:      Starlight
      principal:  ed25519:7f83b1657ff1fc53b92dc18148a1d65dfc2d4b1fa3d677284addd200126d9069
      email:      ddp@eludom.net
      node:       Darwin-arm64 (Apple M4, 10 cores, 32GB)
      federation: Sovereign
      timestamp:  2026-01-06T00:00:00Z
      witness:    threshold(2,3) via Memo-0008
      seal:       BLAKE2b-256

The principal coordinates identify the signer in cyberspace. The
+{sign,delegate} capabilities authorize this document and permit others
to co-sign. The realm is the local sovereign domain. The federation is
the trust boundary. The witness quorum ensures no single point of
authority. The seal binds intent to mathematics.
