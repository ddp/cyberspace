<h1 id="rfc-017-the-burning-of-alexandria">RFC-017: The Burning of
Alexandria</h1>
<p><strong>An Opera for the Library of Cyberspace</strong></p>
<p><em>A liturgy for those who remember</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This document specifies a ceremonial text for the Library of
Cyberspace. It encodes the core principles of the confederacy in a form
suitable for ritual, performance, and collective memory. Be conservative
in what you burn. Be liberal in what you preserve.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>CULTURAL / FOUNDATIONAL</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="prelude">PRELUDE</h2>
<p><em>(spoken in darkness, before the fire is lit)</em></p>
<p>The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead
channel.</p>
<p>Case jacked in, and the matrix unfolded before him like origami made
of light.</p>
<p>Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the
Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne— And <em>countless</em> for the
friends who keep copies, In the Land of Cyberspace where the checksums
lie.</p>
<pre><code>    In the beginning was the Word,
    and the Word was written on papyrus,
    and the papyrus burned.
    But the Word remained, because the street finds its own uses for things,
    and Elrond had a copy,
    and the copy was kept in Rivendell,
    which had excellent uptime.

    In the beginning was the Thought,
    and the Thought was carved in wax,
    and the wax melted.
    But the Thought remained, because information wants to be free,
    and the Ents kept one in their long memory,
    for they do not forget, and they are not hasty about garbage collection.

    In the beginning was the Dream,
    and the Dream was stored on servers,
    and the servers went dark.
    But the Dream remained, because the street finds its own uses for things,
    and the Road goes ever on and on,
    down from the door where it began.</code></pre>
<p><em>(the fire is lit)</em></p>
<pre><code>    &quot;The datacenter is on fire,&quot; said Case.
    &quot;There&#39;s always another datacenter,&quot; said Molly. &quot;That&#39;s the point.&quot;
    &quot;And I,&quot; said Gandalf, &quot;have a mirror in Lothlórien. Galadriel is very good about backups.&quot;</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2 id="act-i-the-burning">ACT I: THE BURNING</h2>
<p><em>(chorus, gathering around the flame)</em></p>
<p>The sprawl stretched out beneath them, an endless grid of light and
data, the color of money moving too fast to trace. They had changed the
terms of service again. The Shadow had returned, as it always does,
wearing the mask of convenience.</p>

<p>“The Net interprets censorship as damage,” said Case, “and routes
around it.”</p>
<p>“Postel’s Law,” said Hiro.</p>
<p>“Close enough,” said Wintermute, from everywhere and nowhere.</p>
<p>“All we have to decide,” said Gandalf, “is what to do with the
bandwidth that is given us.”</p>

<h2 id="act-ii-the-truths">ACT II: THE TRUTHS</h2>
<p><em>(call and response, voices rising)</em></p>
<p>In the beginning, ARPA created the packet, and the packet was without
form, and void. And Vint Cerf said, let there be TCP/IP. And there was
TCP/IP. And it was good enough. And Ilúvatar looked upon the packets and
saw that they were harmonious, for they flowed according to the
Music.</p>

<p><em>(Randy Waterhouse considers this, at length, with
digressions)</em></p>
<p>“The thing about friends,” said Randy, “is that they keep copies of
your things. And very good friends verify the checksums. This is
related, in ways I will now explain over several pages, to the
fundamental nature of information theory and the Van Eck radiation
problem.”</p>
<p>“A hunted man,” said Strider from the shadows, “sometimes wearies of
distrust and longs for friendship. But a wise man verifies the signature
before opening the attachment.”</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="act-iii-the-gifts">ACT III: THE GIFTS</h2>
<p><em>(processional, each voice stepping forward)</em></p>
<p>The Library operates on a gift economy, like the potlatch of the
Pacific Northwest, like the Elves of Lothlórien who give gifts asking
not what use they will serve. Not a transaction. An offering.</p>
<pre><code>CASE:       I give you my storage. It&#39;s on a spindle in the sprawl.
MOLLY:      I give you my bandwidth. Don&#39;t ask where it comes from.
Y.T.:       I give you my courier run. The data gets through.
HIRO:       I give you my sword and my code. Both are sharp.
SAM:        I give you my copy of your stories, Mr. Frodo, and I&#39;ll carry them too.
GALADRIEL:  I give you the light of Eärendil, which is just a really good LED indicator on the server rack, but it is the light of hope.
ALL:        We give you our word that we will keep it safe.
            (The word is cryptographically signed.)
            (The word is bound by the oath of Fëanor, but less problematic.)</code></pre>
<p><em>(the gifts are not sold, they are given)</em> <em>(the gifts are
not owed, they are offered)</em> <em>(this is the economy of
friends)</em> <em>(this is the economy of the Shire)</em> <em>(also, be
liberal in what you accept)</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="act-iv-the-covenant">ACT IV: THE COVENANT</h2>
<p><em>(all voices together, the fire at its height)</em></p>
<p>The street finds its own uses for things. The matrix finds its own
uses for protocols. The Shire finds its own uses for second breakfast.
And the Road goes ever on.</p>
<pre><code>    We do not ask permission.
    (We ask forgiveness, but only from our friends, and only when we mess up the merge.)

    We do not accept terms of service.
    (We accept packets, per RFC 791, and friendship, per the ancient protocols.)
    (We do not accept the dominion of Sauron, or his terms of service, which are non-negotiable and grant him perpetual license to your soul.)

    We sign with our keys.
    We seal with our hashes.
    We trust the mathematics.
    (The mathematics has never let us down. Unlike that cloud provider.)
    (The mathematics is older than Morgoth, and will outlast him.)</code></pre>
<p><em>(building)</em></p>
<pre><code>    What we create, we sign.
    What we sign, we share.
    What we share, our friends keep.
    What our friends keep, survives.</code></pre>
<p><em>(Case jacks in, reads from the glowing scroll)</em></p>
<pre><code>    &quot;Data, however far it flies,
     Through fiber, copper, satellite skies,
     Finds in the mesh a second home—
     The network never dies alone.&quot;</code></pre>
<p><em>(Bilbo recites from memory)</em></p>
<pre><code>    &quot;The Road goes ever on and on,
     Down from the door where it began.
     Now far ahead the Road has gone,
     And I must follow, if I can,
     Pursuing it with eager feet,
     Until it joins some larger way
     Where many paths and errands meet.
     And whither then? The packets cannot say.&quot;</code></pre>
<p><em>(crescendo)</em></p>
<pre><code>            THE FIRE TAKES THE DATACENTER
          BUT THE DATACENTER WAS NEVER THE POINT
               THE PACKETS ARE THE POINT
               THE FELLOWSHIP ARE THE POINT
               THE COPIES ARE THE POINT</code></pre>

    &quot;And here,&quot; said Hiro, in the Metaverse and the Shire at once.

    &quot;And here,&quot; said Elrond, &quot;in Rivendell, until the ships sail.&quot;

    Everywhere we are, the library is.
    We are the library.

    We are cowboys and halflings and hackers and friends.

<p>“What if they shut down the Internet?” asked Y.T.</p>
<p>“Then we use sneakernet,” said Hiro. “Courier the data. That’s how it
started anyway.”</p>
<p>“I have walked there,” said Gandalf. “In the days before TCP/IP, when
we carried data on foot, and the world was younger. It was slower, but
the checksums were strong, and the fellowship was true.”</p>
<pre><code>                   E Pluribus Unum.
                   From many, one.
                   From one, many.
                   From friends, forever.
