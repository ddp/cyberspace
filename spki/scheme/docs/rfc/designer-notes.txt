ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personal history and design decisions behind Cyberspace. This document
grows as the weave deepens.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. LINEAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.1 VMS Security (1984-1994)
----------------------------

DEC was a family. This was merely one specialty.

The Security Project Team was Derrell Piper, Mark Pilant, Andy
Goldstein. TCSEC C2/B1 certification on VAX/VMS and Alpha VMS. VMS 6.0.

What we built:

  * $CHKPRO - the privilege checking gate, the single point where all privilege decisions were made
  * The entire auditing subsystem (final form), comprehensive privilege and access logging
  * C2/B1 certified security model (Orange Book compliance, proven secure)

Access: The security project team (or anyone we designated) were the
only ones allowed in the kernel group's modules. Dave Cutler's team
begrudgingly accepted this as a mandate from heaven (Ken Olsen /
Maynard). We got in on a mandate. We stayed because the work was good.

Inheritance: When Cutler left for Microsoft, his modules were inherited.
The privilege auditing 'rototill' required fluency in MACRO-32.

Text in the Library of Cyberspace is in the color of phosphor green, the
color of VT100s and reflective of IBM green bar printouts. Not retro.
Not nostalgia. Memory.


1.2 The Road Not Taken
----------------------

We all built VAX/VMS V6.0 and then we threw it away--literally tossing
our green bar printouts of our respective subsystems into an empty cube
on ZK03/4. The code of what could have been. The end of DEC.

They must have done something similar after Prism/Mica was cancelled,
ahead of that fateful offer to Gates & Co. that gifted Microsoft
dominance in COTS computing.

Prism/Mica was being designed for TCSEC B1. That's the legacy--the
mindset, the trust model, and the codebase--that Gates was gifted in an
offer they couldn't refuse.

Of all the people at DEC, Cutler--designer of the MicroVAX--could see
the writing on the wall. The age of PCs had been born. Digital missed
the train.

The weave predates the software. The people who understood trust
architectures kept finding each other:

  * DEC -> Microsoft -> Cisco -> here
  * Peter Lofgren was there. There's a photograph of that meeting floating around in PDP-10 space. He ended up at Cisco--our nexus.

The thread is unbroken. From the people who built it, through the people
who maintained it, to the people who understood what was lost. And now
into the code.

That's provenance you can't fake.


1.3 Languages
-------------

BLISS - Bill Wulf at CMU (1969) created BLISS as an expression language,
not 'DEC's C'. Everything returns a value. Lisp in systems clothing.

MACRO-32 - VAX assembly with rich macros. The kernel was MACRO-32.
Learned it from the privilege auditing rototill.

The VMS Runtime - Had a rich macro wrapper for BLISS. That macro system
was a Lisp. We knew. That's why we used it.

A Lisper who fell in love with BLISS (an expression language, like
home).


1.4 System Service Vocabulary
-----------------------------

The VMS system service vocabulary provides the conceptual heritage for
Cyberspace's security primitives.

The security subsystem was written exclusively in BLISS (with MACRO-32
fluency for reading the layers beneath). Now it's Scheme.

Access check pattern:


    $CREATE_USER_PROFILE  >  builds encoded user security profile
            v
    $CHKPRO / $CHECK_ACCESS  >  evaluates access using profile + object protection
            v
    SS$_NORMAL / SS$_NOPRIV  >  grant or deny

Key item codes (CHP$_*):

  * CHP$_ACCESS > access-mask (requested access type bitmask)
  * CHP$_PROT > protection (SOGW protection mask)
  * CHP$_OWNER > owner (object owner identifier)
  * CHP$_UIC > principal (accessor's identity)
  * CHP$_PRIV > privileges (privilege mask)
  * CHP$_ACL > acl (access control list)
  * CHP$_FLAGS > flags (check options: observe/alter)

Flags: CHP$V_AUDIT > audit?, CHP$V_OBSERVE > read?, CHP$V_ALTER > write?

Return status: SS$_NORMAL > #t, SS$_NOPRIV > #f, SS$_ACCVIO > 'accvio,
SS$_IVACL > 'invalid-acl

Impersonation ($PERSONA_*): Used by DECdfs and distributed file services
to act on behalf of remote clients without re-implementing access
checks.

$PERSONA was designed by the DEC Distributed File System group, not VMS
Engineering.

The original $IMPERSONATION framework was authored by myself with Rich
Bouchard. It was lost during the Mitnick incidents when Andy Goldstein
and I decided we needed to rebuild our compiler chain from known good
offsite backups - with Ken Thompson's 'Reflections on Trusting Trust'
fresh in our minds. In doing so, we lost a year of development during
Alpha, including the original kernel threads implementation and the
$IMPERSONATION framework.


1.5 Syntax Heritage
-------------------

Dylan-style keyword arguments are a tribute to Apple Cambridge and MIT:


    (translate text from: 'en to: 'fr)
    (enroll-request name timeout: 30)

Ada/Dylan/BLISS style - named parameters, self-documenting:

  * Ada: Open(File => "data.txt", Mode => Read_Only)
  * Dylan: open(file: "data.txt", mode: #"read")
  * BLISS: OPEN(FILE = 'data.txt', MODE = READONLY)

Self syntax was weird. Smalltalk doesn't work for math people (2 + 3 * 4
= 20, not 14). Scheme is honest - prefix, unambiguous, mathematical.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. DESIGN PRINCIPLES
------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.1 TCB Minimization
--------------------

From TCSEC: 'Small, proven, frozen' - only put in the TCB what you can
verify. VMS C2/B1 taught this. Cyberspace applies it:


    TCB (OCaml):     ~1000 lines, proven in Coq
    Everything else: Chicken Scheme, can evolve freely


2.2 The Vault is the Disk
-------------------------

VAXcluster had multiple subsystems (MSCP, DLM, SCS, quorum disk, LAVC).
Cyberspace has one abstraction: the vault. It subsumes all of them.


2.3 Audit Everything
--------------------

$CHKPRO checked privileges. The auditing subsystem logged decisions.
Both were ours. Cyberspace continues this:


    (define (check-capability actor action resource)
      (let ((granted (spki-verify actor action resource)))
        (audit-append actor: actor action: action granted: granted)
        granted))


------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. INTERFACE PHILOSOPHY
------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.1 English on Top, Scheme Underneath
-------------------------------------


    Terminal:    English verbs for mortals
    REPL:        Scheme for hackers
    Commands:    Forever cast in English/Scheme
    Messages:    Multilingual (the command line speaks your tongue)


3.2 For the Uninitiated
-----------------------


    (about)      ; What is this place?
    (huh?)       ; Same question, different inflection
    (what?)      ; Still the same
    (describe)   ; For the formal

The answer morphs with the weave. Standing alone, it suggests
enrollment. With peers, it lists them. The description reflects the
current state--not a static brochure but a living mirror of the
constellation.

Cyberspace is a system for storing and sharing digital documents, code,
and data without relying on any company, government, or central
authority. Instead of trusting a corporation to keep your files safe,
you and people you trust keep copies that are cryptographically
signed--meaning anyone can verify who created something and that it
hasn't been tampered with. If one computer goes offline, the others
still have everything. Your data belongs to you, verified by math,
preserved by the people you choose.


3.3 Workstations and Terminals
------------------------------

Workstations and terminals weren't wrong. PCs aren't the answer to
everything. The right interface for the job at hand. Sometimes your
native language is superior.

Cyberspace runs on terminals because that's what operators use.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. THE SOUP
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The vault browser is called 'soup' after Newton's persistent object
store (1993).


    Newton soup:      Persistent frames, automatic storage
    Cyberspace soup:  Vault objects, content-addressed

Apple Newton -> Dylan -> Scheme. The soup survives.


    (soup)              ; browse the vault
    (soup 'keys)        ; list keys
    (soup-stat 'alice)  ; inspect object


------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. THE RAGA FAVICON
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Library's favicon is a lambda whose color morphs through the day.


5.1 The Prahar (Watches)
------------------------


    04-06  violet    brahma muhurta (pre-dawn meditation)
    06-08  gold      dawn
    08-11  teal      morning
    11-14  phosphor  midday
    14-17  neon      afternoon
    17-19  orange    sunset
    19-22  coral     evening
    22-04  cyan      night


5.2 Why Ragas?
--------------

Indian classical music assigns ragas to specific times of day. A morning
raga played at midnight is wrong--not because of rules, but because it
doesn't fit. The music knows when it should be heard.


5.3 Why a Breathing Lambda?
---------------------------

The lambda isn't just a logo--it's the fundamental unit. What Scheme
computes, what the weave is made of. Every function, every object, every
sealed thing in the vault is lambdas all the way down.

The color morphing isn't decoration--it's the weave breathing. Lambdas
are being gathered, tested, frozen into vaults across time zones. The
color you see is the pulse of that activity. Dawn gold as the eastern
hemisphere wakes and contributes. Phosphor green at peak hours. Cyan in
the quiet night when the squirrels rest.


5.4 The Easter Egg
------------------

Someone notices their lambda is orange, asks why, and learns: 'You're
seeing sunset. Somewhere, lambdas are being gathered into the weave of
Cyberspace.'

Those who need to ask are in need of enlightenment. The Library is here
to provide it. They came for the RFCs, they left understanding the
lambda.

The brahma muhurta violet isn't just pretty--it's the hour of
enlightenment. If they're seeing violet, they're already up at the right
time.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. LITTLE FLUFFY CLOUDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

'What were the skies like when you were young?' -- The Orb, 1990

The realms in the weave are clouds--little fluffy clouds drifting in
ambient space. The Orb understood distributed systems before we had the
words: layers of sound, samples from elsewhere, everything floating,
nothing anchored to a single point.

Fluffy leads the weave. The name was never arbitrary.

The skies when we were young were phosphor green, VT100s in machine
rooms, the hum of VAXen. Now the clouds are realms, and the realms are
lambdas, and the lambdas float in the wilderness of mirrors.

Ambient for the ages. Distributed for the future.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. DERIVATION VS. DISCOVERY
------------------------------------------------------------------------


7.1 Lamport Time
----------------

In the absence of global clock synchronization, distributed systems
establish causal ordering through logical clocks (Lamport, 1978). Each
node maintains a local counter incremented on message send/receive,
establishing a happens-before relation that provides partial ordering
without requiring synchronized wall-clock time.

The happens-before relation was always there--Lamport gave it a name and
a notation. That's discovery. Seeing what was already true.


7.2 call/cc
-----------

Most language features are about what you can say. call/cc is about what
exists.

call/cc says: the future of the computation is a value you can hold,
store, invoke later. Continuations. Time as a first-class object. That's
not syntax preference--that's ontology.

The continuation exists whether you capture it or not--call/cc just lets
you name it. The future was always there, implicit in every expression.
Scheme made it explicit.

SICP wasn't about parentheses. It was a course in thinking, disguised as
a programming textbook. Streams, lazy evaluation, the environment model,
the metacircular evaluator--and then call/cc, which breaks your brain
the right way.


7.3 The Y Combinator
--------------------

The Y combinator (Y = λf.(λx.f(x x))(λx.f(x x))) is a fixed-point
combinator enabling recursion without explicit self-reference. It's
elegant. It's also just math that falls out of lambda
calculus--derivation, not discovery.

A certain Silicon Valley venture capital firm took the name as borrowed
plumage. Value signaling to people who recognize the symbol but don't
work in the calculus. The firm's founder wrote 'On Lisp', evangelized
the aesthetic--but Arc didn't have call/cc. Common Lisp doesn't have it.
He came from the CL side, where continuations aren't primitive.

Naming the firm 'Y Combinator' signals: I read the cool parts. Not
naming it 'call/cc' signals: I stopped before it got weird.

The Y combinator is page 300 of SICP. call/cc is the last chapter. Most
people don't finish.


7.4 The Distinction
-------------------

Derivation: The Y combinator. Recursion falling out of self-application.
True but not illuminating.

Discovery: Lamport clocks. call/cc. Seeing structure that was always
there, giving it a name, making it usable.

Cyberspace is built on discoveries: happens-before for distributed time,
continuations for control flow, SPKI for authorization. The derivations
are implementation details.
