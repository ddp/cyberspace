<h2>What Is This?</h2>
<p>Imagine a library where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your work is safe - because friends keep copies for each other</li>
<li>Nothing gets lost - even if one computer fails</li>
<li>You know who made what - like a signature on a painting</li>
<li>It belongs to everyone - like a community garden</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the Library of Cyberspace.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
<p>We all have things worth keeping: family photos, creative work, research, code, things we want to pass on.</p>
<p>Right now, most of this lives on company servers. That works great... until the company shuts down, your account gets locked, or something just disappears.</p>
<p>Friends don't disappear. Friends keep copies.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>The Simple Idea</h2>
<p>What if preserving things worked like borrowing books from friends?</p>
<pre>
    You &lt;----&gt; Friend &lt;----&gt; Friend
     |           |             |
     +-----------+-------------+
                 |
      Everyone helps everyone.
      Like a neighborhood library,
      but for anything digital.
</pre>
<p>That's really all this is.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Our Promise to Each Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>We keep copies - so nothing is lost</li>
<li>We verify authenticity - so nothing is changed</li>
<li>We share generously - because that's what friends do</li>
<li>We help each other - because together we're stronger</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Newton for Cyberspace</h2>
<p>In 1993, Apple made something called the Newton. It had a revolutionary idea: your stuff just exists. You don't save files or open documents. Things float in a soup of objects, and you find them by asking questions.</p>
<p>The Newton died because it needed a network that didn't exist yet. We have that network now.</p>
<p>We're building the Newton it deserves: a soup that spans friends, objects that prove themselves, identity without permission, memory that can't be rewritten.</p>

<h2>RFC Purpose</h2>
<p>These Request for Comments documents serve as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design Records</strong>: Why decisions were made</li>
<li><strong>Implementation Specifications</strong>: How features work</li>
<li><strong>Security Analysis</strong>: Threat models and mitigations</li>
<li><strong>Future Reference</strong>: Understanding the system later</li>

<h2>Lineage</h2>
<p>Cyberspace stands on giants:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>System</th><th>Era</th><th>What We Learned</th></tr>
<tr><td>VMS Clusters</td><td>1983</td><td>SET HOST - distributed presence</td></tr>
<tr><td>Newton</td><td>1993</td><td>The soup - objects as medium, queries as navigation</td></tr>
<tr><td>General Magic</td><td>1994</td><td>Agents that travel, carry intent, return with results</td></tr>
<tr><td>SPKI/SDSI</td><td>1996</td><td>Capabilities, not identities</td></tr>
<tr><td>AS/400</td><td>1988</td><td>Capability-based addressing</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cambridge CAP</td><td>1970s</td><td>Hardware capabilities</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Cyberspace is their synthesis: local-first realms, federated via capabilities, with agents swimming in the soup.</p>
</section>

<h2>Glossary</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Term</th><th>Definition</th></tr>
<tr><td>Realm</td><td>A node's place in cyberspace - vault, principal, capabilities, objects. Local-first, sovereign.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vault</td><td>The local content-addressed object store. The realm's storage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Principal</td><td>A node's cryptographic identity (Ed25519 public key).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Soup</td><td>The queryable object space. A wilderness of mirrors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Seal</td><td>Cryptographic binding - signing, archiving, committing. The primary verb.</td></tr>

<p>The Library of Alexandria burned. We can do better now.</p>
<p>Not with a building, but with friendship. Not with guards, but with mathematics.</p>
