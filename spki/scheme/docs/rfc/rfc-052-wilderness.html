<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This RFC defines the Wilderness - the interstitial space between realms in Cyberspace. It establishes the cosmology of realms, wormholes, and affiliation.</p>
</section>

<h2>1. The Wilderness</h2>
<p>The Wilderness is the space between all realms. It is not empty - it is the medium through which all connections pass.</p>

<h2>2. States of Being</h2>
<h3>2.1 Unaffiliated</h3>
<p>When you first enter Cyberspace, you are unaffiliated. You exist in the Wilderness with no realm to call home.</p>
<pre>
You are unaffiliated, in the wilderness.
</pre>
<p>This is the starting state. You have not: - Instantiated your own realm - Joined a confederation - Established any identity</p>
<h3>2.2 Realm Instantiation</h3>
<p>To leave the Wilderness, you must instantiate a realm:</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(create-realm 'myname)    ; create your own realm
;; or
(enroll-request 'myname)  ; join an existing confederation
</pre>
<p>Once affiliated, you have a home:</p>
<pre>
You entered the yoyodyne realm 5 minutes ago.
</pre>
<h3>2.3 Wormhole Transit</h3>
<p>Wormholes punch through the Wilderness to connect realms. When traversing a wormhole, you pass through the Wilderness - the same Wilderness where the unaffiliated wait.</p>
<pre>
realm A ──► [wilderness] ──► realm B
                 ↑
            wormhole transit
</pre>

<h2>3. Properties of the Wilderness</h2>
<h3>3.1 Universality</h3>
<p>There is one Wilderness. All realms exist as islands within it. All wormholes traverse it.</p>
<h3>3.2 Neutrality</h3>
<p>The Wilderness belongs to no one. It has no authority, no governance, no federation. It simply is.</p>
<h3>3.3 Connectivity</h3>
<p>The Wilderness enables connection. Without it, realms would be isolated. Wormholes work because they have something to traverse.</p>

<h2>4. The Wilderness of Mirrors</h2>
<p>A double-entendre:</p>
<h3>4.1 Angleton's Wilderness</h3>
<p>James Jesus Angleton, CIA counterintelligence chief, borrowed "wilderness of mirrors" from T.S. Eliot to describe the world of espionage. A place where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflexive control is dominant</li>
<li>Nothing is as it seems</li>
<li>Disinformation is the norm</li>
<li>Trust is a vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<p>In Cyberspace, the Wilderness acknowledges this reality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trust is not given, it is established cryptographically</li>
<li>Identity is not assumed, it is proven with keys</li>
<li>Every claim requires verification</li>
<li>The default stance is skepticism</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.2 The Tribal Wilderness</h3>
<p>The older meaning: outside civilization, unaffiliated with any tribe.</p>
<ul>
<li>No confederation claims you</li>
<li>No federation protects you</li>
<li>You belong to no one</li>
<li>You are alone</li>
</ul>
<p>Both meanings apply. The unaffiliated user is: - In a world where trust must be earned (Angleton) - Outside any group until they join one (tribal)</p>
<p>The Wilderness is honest about both. You are alone. Trust nothing but your own crypto keys.</p>

<h2>5. User Interface</h2>
<h3>5.1 Status Line</h3>
<pre>
wilderness │ just now │ quiet
</pre>
<p>When affiliated:</p>
<pre>
yoyodyne │ 5 minutes │ replicating
</pre>
<h3>5.2 Introspection</h3>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(self?)
;; "You are unaffiliated, in the wilderness."

(federation?)
;; "You are not part of any confederation.
;;  No peers discovered."
</pre>
</section>
<section>
<h2>6. Design Rationale</h2>
<p>The Wilderness serves multiple purposes:</p>
<p>1. Honest onboarding - Users know they are not yet part of anything 2. Unified metaphor - Same space for unaffiliated and wormhole transit 3. Security clarity - No implicit trust, no assumed identity 4. Poetic resonance - Evokes the uncertainty of the unaffiliated state</p>
