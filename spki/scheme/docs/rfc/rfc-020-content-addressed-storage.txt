RFC-020: Content-Addressed Storage

Status: Draft Date: January 2026 Author: Derrell Piper ddp@eludom.net
Implementation: Proposed

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract

This RFC specifies content-addressed storage (CAS) for the Library of
Cyberspace: a storage model where data is addressed by its cryptographic hash
rather than by location. Content addressing provides immutability guarantees,
automatic deduplication, and tamper-evident storage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motivation

Traditional storage systems use location-based addressing:

- DECtape: Physical position on magnetic tape
- Filesystems: Path names (/home/ddp/file.txt)
- Databases: Row IDs, primary keys
- URLs: Server + path (https://example.com/doc.ps)

Location-based addressing has fundamental problems:

1.  Mutability - Same address can point to different content over time
2.  Link rot - Addresses become invalid when content moves
3.  Duplication - Identical content stored multiple times
4.  No verification - Address doesn’t prove content integrity

Content-addressed storage inverts this:

    Location-based:  address → content (many-to-one, mutable)
    Content-based:   content → address (one-to-one, immutable)

The address IS the content’s cryptographic fingerprint. If the content
changes, the address changes. If two files have the same address, they are
byte-for-byte identical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Content Addressing Model

Hash as Address

    ;; Content determines address
    (define (content-address data)
      (sha256 data))

    ;; Store by hash
    (define (cas-store data)
      (let ((hash (content-address data)))
        (write-blob (hash->path hash) data)
        hash))

    ;; Retrieve by hash
    (define (cas-retrieve hash)
      (let ((data (read-blob (hash->path hash))))
        (if (equal? hash (content-address data))
            data
            (error "Content tampered"))))

Properties

  Property               Location-Based   Content-Addressed
  ---------------------- ---------------- -------------------
  Address stability      Unstable         Permanent
  Content verification   External         Intrinsic
  Deduplication          Manual           Automatic
  Mutability             Mutable          Immutable
  Link rot               Common           Impossible

Hash Function Requirements

The hash function MUST be:

1.  Collision-resistant - Computationally infeasible to find two inputs with
    same hash
2.  Preimage-resistant - Cannot derive content from hash
3.  Deterministic - Same content always produces same hash
4.  Fast - Practical for large objects

Specified hash: SHA-256 (32 bytes, 64 hex characters)

    ;; Example content address
    "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"
    ;; This is the SHA-256 of the empty string

Sharding: First two hex characters of hash form directory name (256 buckets).

Object Types

    ;; Blob - raw data
    (cas-blob
      (hash "sha256:...")
      (size 1024)
      (data #${...}))

    ;; Tree - directory structure
    (cas-tree
      (hash "sha256:...")
      (entries
        (("README.md" blob "sha256:abc...")
         ("src" tree "sha256:def...")
         ("lib" tree "sha256:ghi..."))))

    ;; Commit - snapshot with metadata
    (cas-commit
      (hash "sha256:...")
      (tree "sha256:...")
      (parent "sha256:..." | #f)
      (author "ddp@eludom.net")
      (timestamp 1767700000)
      (message "Initial commit"))

Merkle Trees

Directories are trees of hashes. The root hash commits to all content:

                        root: sha256:abc...
                             /          \
                  src: sha256:def     lib: sha256:ghi
                   /        \              |
            main.scm     test.scm      util.scm
            sha256:111   sha256:222    sha256:333

Changing ANY file changes ALL parent hashes up to root.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operations

Store

    (define (cas-put content)
      "Store content, return hash"
      (let* ((hash (sha256 content))
             (path (hash->path hash)))
        (unless (file-exists? path)
          (write-blob path content))
        hash))

Deduplication: If hash already exists, storage is a no-op.

Retrieve

    (define (cas-get hash)
      "Retrieve content by hash, verify integrity"
      (let* ((path (hash->path hash))
             (content (read-blob path)))
        (unless (equal? hash (sha256 content))
          (error "Content integrity failure" hash))
        content))

Self-verifying: Every retrieval confirms integrity.

Exists

    (define (cas-exists? hash)
      "Check if content exists"
      (file-exists? (hash->path hash)))

Delete

    (define (cas-gc roots)
      "Garbage collect unreachable objects"
      (let ((reachable (trace-reachable roots)))
        (for-each
          (lambda (hash)
            (unless (set-member? reachable hash)
              (delete-file (hash->path hash))))
          (all-objects))))

Note: Deletion requires garbage collection from known roots.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Naming Layer

Content addresses are not human-friendly. A naming layer maps names to hashes:

References

    ;; Mutable reference to immutable content
    (define (ref-set name hash)
      (write-file (ref-path name) hash))

    (define (ref-get name)
      (read-file (ref-path name)))

    ;; Example
    (ref-set "HEAD" "sha256:abc123...")
    (ref-get "HEAD") ; => "sha256:abc123..."

Tags

    ;; Immutable named reference
    (define (tag-create name hash #!key message signature)
      (let ((tag-content
             `(tag
               (name ,name)
               (object ,hash)
               (message ,message)
               (signature ,signature))))
        (cas-put (serialize tag-content))))

Directory Entries

    ;; Human name -> content hash
    (define library-index
      '(("RFC-000" . "sha256:e3b0c44...")
        ("RFC-001" . "sha256:a7ffc6f...")
        ("RFC-002" . "sha256:b94d27b...")))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Soup: Object Directory

Content-addressed storage provides retrieval by hash, but discovery requires
an object directory. The Soup (inspired by NewtonOS) provides a unified view
of all objects with rich metadata.

Philosophy

  “The soup is infinite.” - Objects swim in a queryable sea of metadata.

The Soup inverts the traditional filesystem model:

- Filesystem: Navigate hierarchy to find objects
- Soup: Query attributes to discover objects

Object Enumeration

    (define (soup)
      "List all objects in the vault with metadata"
      (append
        (soup-releases)      ; Signed releases
        (soup-archives)      ; Sealed archives
        (soup-keys)          ; Cryptographic keys
        (soup-audit-entries) ; Audit trail
        (soup-commits)))     ; Recent commits

Rich Metadata

Every object carries crypto metadata - the ciphers, hashes, and keys involved:

    ;; Archive object
    (soup-object
      (name "1.0.0")
      (type archive)
      (size "1.2MB")
      (crypto (zstd sha256 "fe378a78...")))

    ;; Key object
    (soup-object
      (name "vault-signing")
      (type key)
      (size "64B")
      (crypto (ed25519/256 public sign
               "sha256:a1b2c3d4..."    ; fingerprint
               "id:ddp@eludom.net"     ; identity
               "2026-01-07")))         ; creation date

    ;; Release object
    (soup-object
      (name "0.1.0")
      (type release)
      (size "313B")
      (crypto (ed25519 sha512 "abc123...")))

Querying the Soup

    ;; Find all signed objects
    (soup-query type: 'release)

    ;; Find objects using specific algorithm
    (soup-query crypto: 'ed25519)

    ;; Find objects by size range
    (soup-query min-size: 1000 max-size: 100000)

    ;; Find objects by content hash prefix
    (soup-query hash-prefix: "fe378")

Display Format

The soup displays as a compact, human-readable listing:

    $ seal-soup
    vault-signing, 64B, ed25519/256, public, sign, sha256:a1b2c3d4...
    0.1.0, 313B, signed, ed25519, sha512
    1.0.0, 1.2MB, zstd, sha256, fe378a78...
    audit/1, sealed, 2026-01-07T10:30:00Z

Soup as Index

The Soup can be serialized as a content-addressed index:

    (define (soup-snapshot)
      "Create content-addressed snapshot of current soup"
      (let* ((entries (soup))
             (serialized (serialize entries))
             (hash (cas-put serialized)))
        (ref-set "soup/HEAD" hash)
        hash))

This enables: - Time travel: Load historical soup snapshots - Replication:
Sync soup indexes between vaults - Verification: Prove soup state at a point
in time

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integration with Library of Cyberspace

Vault Integration

The Vault (RFC-006) uses content addressing internally via Git:

    ;; Git objects ARE content-addressed
    (define (git-hash-object content)
      (sha1 (string-append "blob " (number->string (blob-length content)) "\x00" content)))

CAS extends this with SHA-256 and Library-specific semantics.

Archive Storage

Sealed archives (RFC-018) can be stored by content address:

    (define (archive-to-cas archive-path)
      (let* ((content (read-blob archive-path))
             (hash (cas-put content)))
        (ref-set (string-append "archives/" (archive-version archive-path)) hash)
        hash))

Replication

Content addressing enables efficient replication (RFC-001):

    ;; Only transfer objects receiver doesn't have
    (define (replicate-to remote root-hash)
      (for-each
        (lambda (hash)
          (unless (remote-has? remote hash)
            (remote-put remote hash (cas-get hash))))
        (trace-reachable root-hash)))

SPKI Integration

Content hashes can be authorization subjects (RFC-004):

    ;; Grant permission to specific content
    (spki-cert
      (issuer publisher-key)
      (subject (hash sha256 "abc123..."))
      (permission read)
      (validity (not-after "2027-01-01")))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunking for Large Objects

Large files are split into chunks for:

1.  Deduplication at sub-file granularity
2.  Parallel transfer
3.  Incremental updates

Fixed-Size Chunking

    (define chunk-size (* 64 1024))  ; 64KB

    (define (chunk-fixed data)
      (let loop ((offset 0) (chunks '()))
        (if (>= offset (blob-length data))
            (reverse chunks)
            (loop (+ offset chunk-size)
                  (cons (blob-copy data offset (min chunk-size (- (blob-length data) offset)))
                        chunks)))))

Content-Defined Chunking (Rabin fingerprinting)

    ;; Chunk boundaries determined by content
    ;; Survives insertions/deletions better than fixed-size
    (define (chunk-rabin data)
      (let ((window-size 48)
            (min-chunk 2048)
            (max-chunk 65536)
            (mask #x0fff))  ; Average 4KB chunks
        ...))

Chunk Tree

    (cas-chunked
      (hash "sha256:...")      ; Root hash
      (size 10485760)          ; 10MB original
      (chunks
        ("sha256:aaa..." 65536)
        ("sha256:bbb..." 65536)
        ("sha256:ccc..." 32768)
        ...))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introspection

The Library is fully introspective: it stores, addresses, and reasons about
itself.

Self-Hosting

The system contains its own description:

    ;; The RFCs are in the CAS
    (cas-get (ref-get "rfc/020"))  ; => This document

    ;; The code is in the CAS
    (cas-get (ref-get "src/vault.scm"))  ; => Implementation

    ;; The schema is in the CAS
    (cas-get (ref-get "schema/soup-object"))  ; => Soup object definition

Meta-Objects

Objects that describe objects:

    ;; Schema for soup objects (itself a soup object)
    (soup-object
      (name "schema/soup-object")
      (type schema)
      (size "412B")
      (crypto (sha256 "def456..."))
      (describes soup-object))

    ;; The soup can enumerate itself
    (soup-query type: 'schema)  ; => All schemas including this one

Reflexive Queries

The soup answers questions about itself:

    ;; What types exist?
    (soup-types)  ; => (archive release key audit commit schema ...)

    ;; What crypto algorithms are in use?
    (soup-algorithms)  ; => (sha256 ed25519 zstd age ...)

    ;; What is the total size of the vault?
    (soup-total-size)  ; => 47.3MB

    ;; How much deduplication?
    (soup-dedup-ratio)  ; => 0.73 (27% space saved)

Provenance

Every object knows its origin:

    (soup-object
      (name "rfc-020.ps")
      (type blob)
      (size "89KB")
      (crypto (sha256 "abc123..."))
      (provenance
        (created-by "ddp@eludom.net")
        (created-at 1767700000)
        (derived-from "sha256:fff888...")
        (tool "dvips")))

Provenance chains are themselves content-addressed:

    ;; Trace full history
    (define (provenance-chain hash)
      (let ((obj (soup-get hash)))
        (if (soup-object-derived-from obj)
            (cons obj (provenance-chain (soup-object-derived-from obj)))
            (list obj))))

Audit of Audits

The audit trail audits itself:

    ;; Audit entry for an audit entry
    (audit-entry
      (id 42)
      (actor vault-key)
      (action (audit-append 41))  ; Recorded adding entry 41
      (timestamp 1767700100))

    ;; The audit trail is in the soup
    (soup-query type: 'audit)  ; => All audit entries as soup objects

Bootstrapping

The system can describe how to build itself:

    ;; Bootstrap manifest - everything needed to reconstruct
    (bootstrap-manifest
      (hash "sha256:bootstrap...")
      (contents
        (("src/" tree "sha256:src...")
         ("rfcs/" tree "sha256:rfcs...")
         ("keys/" tree "sha256:keys...")
         ("schema/" tree "sha256:schema...")))
      (build-instructions
        "Load src/boot.scm, call (bootstrap)"))

    ;; Verify bootstrap integrity
    (define (verify-bootstrap)
      (let ((manifest (cas-get (ref-get "bootstrap"))))
        (for-each verify-tree (manifest-contents manifest))))

Homoiconic storage: the description is the thing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extended Object Types

The soup contains not just data objects but active entities. Principals, agents,
and wormholes are first-class objects with intrinsic statistics.

Principals

Cryptographic identities with usage statistics:

    (soup-object
      (type principal)
      (name "alice")
      (key #${ed25519-public-key})
      (rollback full)
      (stats
        (signatures-issued 47)
        (delegations-granted 3)
        (delegations-received 1)
        (last-active "2026-01-08T14:30:00Z")
        (created "2026-01-06"))
      (history
        (v1 (created "2026-01-06"))
        (v2 (delegations-granted 1) "2026-01-07")
        (v3 (delegations-granted 3) "2026-01-08")))

Agents

Actors that operate on behalf of principals:

    (soup-object
      (type agent)
      (name "claude")
      (principal "alice")
      (kind ai)
      (rollback full)
      (stats
        (actions-performed 1247)
        (commits-authored 89)
        (co-authorships 89)
        (last-action "2026-01-08T14:45:00Z")
        (created "2026-01-07"))
      (capabilities
        (read #t)
        (write #t)
        (sign #f)))

Agent kinds: human, ai, automated, daemon.

Wormholes

Transport channels between nodes with transit statistics:

    (soup-object
      (type wormhole)
      (name "fluffy↔om")
      (endpoints ("fluffy" "om"))
      (transport starlink)
      (rollback snapshot)
      (stats
        (transits 4721)
        (bytes-in 847293847)
        (bytes-out 923847234)
        (errors 3)
        (last-transit "2026-01-08T14:40:00Z")
        (established "2026-01-07")
        (snapshots
          ("2026-01-07" (transits 1000) (bytes-in 100000000))
          ("2026-01-08" (transits 4721) (bytes-in 847293847)))))

Statistics as Protected Properties

Object statistics are intrinsic, not external. They live inside the object
and are protected by the same cryptographic signature:

    (object
      (type principal)
      (name "alice")
      (key #${...})
      (stats ...)           ; Statistics are part of the signed content
      (audit ...)           ; Audit trail is part of the object
      (signature #${...}))  ; Signature covers everything above

This provides:

1. Tamper evidence - Modify stats, signature fails
2. Atomicity - Stats update with object update
3. Provenance - Stats share object's audit trail
4. Replication - Stats replicate with object

The object knows itself. Ask any object "what have you been doing?" and it
can answer from its own intrinsic state.

Auditing as Universal Attribute

Every object carries its own audit trail - auditing is not a separate object
type but an intrinsic attribute of all objects:

    (object
      (type wormhole)
      (name "fluffy↔om")
      (stats ...)
      (audit
        (created (actor "ddp") (timestamp "2026-01-07T10:00:00Z"))
        (modified (actor "claude") (timestamp "2026-01-08T14:00:00Z")
                  (fields (transits 4721)))
        (accessed (actor "om") (timestamp "2026-01-08T14:40:00Z"))))

The audit trail records:
- Creation (who, when)
- Modifications (who, when, what changed)
- Access (who, when) - optional, for sensitive objects
- Delegation (who granted what to whom)

Audit entries are append-only within the object. When the object is signed,
its audit trail is sealed. The complete history travels with the object.

Audit Levels

Auditing verbosity is configurable at two levels:

1. Root level - A property of cyberspace itself, set by consensus
2. Per-object level - Each object can override with its own setting

    ;; Cyberspace root audit policy (set by M-of-N consensus)
    (cyberspace-config
      (audit-level light))  ; Default for all objects

    ;; Per-object override
    (object
      (type principal)
      (name "alice")
      (audit-level full)    ; This principal wants full auditing
      ...)

Audit levels:

  Level     Records                                   Use case
  --------- ----------------------------------------- ----------------------
  none      Nothing                                   High-frequency counters
  light     Creation, major modifications (default)   Normal operations
  full      All access, all modifications             Sensitive objects
  paranoid  Everything including reads                Security-critical

Default is light - sufficient for forensics without storage bloat. Objects
can escalate their own auditing; consensus can mandate minimum levels.

Soup Auditing (VAX/VMS and TrustedBSD heritage)

The soup's audit system draws from VAX/VMS Security Auditing and TrustedBSD's
Basic Security Module (BSM), expressed in soup idiom:

Event Classes (ripples in the soup):

    (soup-ripples
      (auth       "Principal enters the soup")
      (touch      "Object touched (read)")
      (stir       "Object modified")
      (evaporate  "Object removed")
      (pour       "Delegation flows between principals")
      (season     "Administrative seasoning")
      (recipe     "Policy changes")
      (seal       "Cryptographic operations"))

Principal Attention (what each principal notices):

    (soup-object
      (type principal)
      (name "alice")
      (attention
        (on-success (auth touch season))   ; Notice these when they work
        (on-failure (auth touch stir))))   ; Notice these when they fail

Object Sensitivity (what the object broadcasts):

    (soup-object
      (name "crown-jewels")
      (sensitivity
        (on-success (touch stir evaporate))
        (on-failure (touch stir evaporate))
        (alarm-on (evaporate))))           ; Scream if deleted

Alarm vs Ripple:
- Ripple: Propagates through soup, recorded for later
- Alarm: Immediate notification (bubbles to surface)

    (soup-policy
      (alarm-on (failure auth))            ; Bubble on bad auth
      (alarm-on (success evaporate))       ; Bubble on any deletion
      (ripple-on (success touch)))         ; Quiet ripple on reads

Soup Entry Format (what gets recorded):

    (soup-entry
      (ripple touch)
      (class touch)
      (when "2026-01-08T15:00:00Z")
      (outcome success)
      (who
        (principal "alice")
        (agent "claude")
        (node "fluffy"))
      (what
        (type archive)
        (name "vault-2.0.0.archive")
        (hash "sha512:abc..."))
      (how read)
      (result 0))

Rollback Strategy by Type

Objects declare their rollback contract (see RFC-015):

  Type        Strategy    Rationale
  ----------- ----------- ----------------------------------------
  principal   full        Trust changes need complete history
  agent       full        Permission/capability changes reversible
  policy      full        Access control must be recoverable
  identity    full        Node role changes are significant
  wormhole    snapshot    Transit counters only grow
  archive     none        Immutable once sealed
  release     none        Signed, hash-locked
  signature   none        Cryptographic commitment

Note: Auditing is a universal attribute, not a separate type. Every object
carries its own audit trail as an intrinsic property.

Querying Active Entities

    ;; All principals
    (soup-query type: 'principal)

    ;; Agents by kind
    (soup-query type: 'agent kind: 'ai)

    ;; Active wormholes
    (soup-query type: 'wormhole min-transits: 1)

    ;; Most active principal
    (soup-top type: 'principal order-by: 'signatures-issued)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tombstones

Objects are never truly deleted - they are marked with tombstones.

Soft Deletion

    (define (cas-tombstone hash #!key reason actor)
      "Mark object as deleted without removing it"
      (let ((tombstone
             `(tombstone
               (object ,hash)
               (deleted-at ,(current-seconds))
               (deleted-by ,actor)
               (reason ,reason))))
        (audit-append action: `(tombstone ,hash) motivation: reason)
        (cas-put (serialize tombstone))))

Tombstone Properties

    (soup-object
      (name "sha256:deadbeef...")
      (type tombstone)
      (size "0B")  ; Logical size is zero
      (status deleted)
      (reason "Superseded by sha256:newversion...")
      (recoverable #t))

Recovery

    (define (cas-resurrect hash)
      "Remove tombstone, restore object visibility"
      (let ((tombstone (find-tombstone hash)))
        (when tombstone
          (audit-append action: `(resurrect ,hash))
          (cas-delete (tombstone-hash tombstone)))))

Garbage Collection with Tombstones

    (define (cas-gc roots #!key preserve-tombstones)
      "GC respects tombstones by default"
      (let ((reachable (trace-reachable roots))
            (tombstoned (all-tombstoned-hashes)))
        (for-each
          (lambda (hash)
            (unless (or (set-member? reachable hash)
                        (and preserve-tombstones
                             (set-member? tombstoned hash)))
              (delete-file (hash->path hash))))
          (all-objects))))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pinning

Pinned objects are protected from garbage collection.

Pin Operations

    (define (cas-pin hash #!key recursive reason)
      "Pin object (and optionally its references)"
      (let ((pin `(pin
                   (object ,hash)
                   (pinned-at ,(current-seconds))
                   (recursive ,recursive)
                   (reason ,reason))))
        (write-file (pin-path hash) (serialize pin))
        (when recursive
          (for-each (lambda (ref) (cas-pin ref recursive: #t))
                    (object-references hash)))))

    (define (cas-unpin hash)
      "Remove pin, allow GC"
      (delete-file (pin-path hash)))

    (define (cas-pinned? hash)
      "Check if object is pinned"
      (file-exists? (pin-path hash)))

Pin Manifest

    ;; All pins as soup objects
    (soup-query type: 'pin)

    ;; Pin statistics
    (soup-pin-count)      ; => 142 objects pinned
    (soup-pinned-size)    ; => 23.4MB

Root Pins

Certain objects are implicitly pinned:

    (define implicit-roots
      '("HEAD"           ; Current commit
        "refs/tags/*"    ; All tags
        "bootstrap"      ; System bootstrap
        "schema/*"))     ; All schemas

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bloom Filters

Compact probabilistic set membership for efficient replication.

Structure

    (define (make-bloom-filter capacity error-rate)
      "Create bloom filter for approximate membership"
      (let* ((bits (bloom-optimal-bits capacity error-rate))
             (hashes (bloom-optimal-hashes capacity bits)))
        (bloom-filter
          (bit-vector (make-vector bits 0))
          (hash-count hashes)
          (capacity capacity)
          (error-rate error-rate))))

Operations

    (define (bloom-add! filter hash)
      "Add hash to bloom filter"
      (for-each
        (lambda (i)
          (bit-vector-set! (bloom-bits filter) (bloom-index filter hash i) 1))
        (iota (bloom-hash-count filter))))

    (define (bloom-contains? filter hash)
      "Check if hash MIGHT be in filter (false positives possible)"
      (every
        (lambda (i)
          (= 1 (bit-vector-ref (bloom-bits filter) (bloom-index filter hash i))))
        (iota (bloom-hash-count filter))))

Replication Protocol

    ;; Sender: "Here's what I have"
    (define (bloom-inventory)
      (let ((filter (make-bloom-filter 10000 0.01)))
        (for-each (lambda (hash) (bloom-add! filter hash))
                  (all-object-hashes))
        filter))

    ;; Receiver: "Send me what I'm missing"
    (define (bloom-diff local-filter remote-filter)
      (filter (lambda (hash)
                (and (bloom-contains? remote-filter hash)
                     (not (cas-exists? hash))))
              (all-object-hashes)))

    ;; Exchange is O(bloom-size) not O(object-count)

Soup Integration

    ;; Bloom filter itself is a soup object
    (soup-object
      (name "bloom/2026-01-07")
      (type bloom-filter)
      (size "12KB")
      (crypto (sha256 "bloom-hash..."))
      (capacity 10000)
      (error-rate 0.01)
      (population 4723))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Content Types

Typed objects with schema validation.

Type Registry

    (define content-types
      '((blob        . "application/octet-stream")
        (text        . "text/plain")
        (markdown    . "text/markdown")
        (scheme      . "text/x-scheme")
        (sexp        . "application/x-sexp")
        (json        . "application/json")
        (pdf         . "application/pdf")
        (archive     . "application/x-sealed-archive")
        (key         . "application/x-spki-key")
        (certificate . "application/x-spki-cert")))

Typed Storage

    (define (cas-put/typed content type #!key schema)
      "Store with type metadata"
      (let* ((hash (sha256 content))
             (meta `(typed-object
                     (hash ,hash)
                     (type ,type)
                     (size ,(blob-length content))
                     (schema ,schema))))
        (cas-put content)
        (cas-put (serialize meta))
        hash))

Schema Validation

    (define (cas-validate hash)
      "Validate object against its schema"
      (let* ((meta (cas-get-meta hash))
             (schema-hash (typed-object-schema meta))
             (schema (cas-get schema-hash))
             (content (cas-get hash)))
        (schema-validate schema content)))

    ;; Schema is itself content-addressed
    (soup-object
      (name "schema/soup-object")
      (type schema)
      (validates soup-object)
      (crypto (sha256 "schema-hash...")))

MIME Detection

    (define (cas-detect-type content)
      "Detect content type from magic bytes"
      (cond
        ((pdf-magic? content) 'pdf)
        ((gzip-magic? content) 'archive)
        ((utf8-text? content)
         (cond
           ((sexp-syntax? content) 'sexp)
           ((markdown-syntax? content) 'markdown)
           (else 'text)))
        (else 'blob)))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object Capabilities

Content addresses as capabilities: if you know the hash, you can retrieve it.

Hash as Capability

    ;; Knowledge of hash grants read access
    (define (cas-get-if-known hash)
      "Capability-based retrieval"
      (if (valid-hash? hash)
          (cas-get hash)
          (error "Invalid capability")))

    ;; Hashes are unguessable (256-bit entropy)
    ;; Sharing a hash = sharing read access

Capability Attenuation

    ;; SPKI certificate granting access to specific content
    (spki-cert
      (issuer vault-key)
      (subject reader-key)
      (permission (read (hash sha256 "specific-content...")))
      (validity (not-after "2027-01-01")))

    ;; Grant access to a subtree
    (spki-cert
      (issuer vault-key)
      (subject reader-key)
      (permission (read (tree sha256 "subtree-root...")))
      (propagate #t))  ; Access to all referenced objects

Sealed Capabilities

    ;; Encrypted capability - only holder of key can use
    (define (seal-capability hash recipient-key)
      (let ((cap `(capability
                   (object ,hash)
                   (granted-at ,(current-seconds)))))
        (age-encrypt (serialize cap) recipient-key)))

    ;; Recipient decrypts to obtain hash
    (define (unseal-capability sealed-cap identity)
      (let ((cap (deserialize (age-decrypt sealed-cap identity))))
        (capability-object cap)))

Capability Revocation

    ;; Revocation via tombstone
    (define (revoke-capability hash)
      (cas-tombstone hash reason: "Capability revoked"))

    ;; Or via SPKI CRL
    (spki-crl
      (issuer vault-key)
      (revoked
        ((hash sha256 "revoked-content...")
         (reason "Superseded")
         (revoked-at 1767700000))))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hash Migration

When cryptographic algorithms weaken, the system must migrate.

Multihash

    ;; Self-describing hash format
    (define (multihash algo data)
      (let ((hash (case algo
                    ((sha256) (sha256 data))
                    ((sha384) (sha384 data))
                    ((sha512) (sha512 data))
                    ((blake3) (blake3 data)))))
        (list algo (blob-length hash) hash)))

    ;; Parse multihash
    (define (multihash-algorithm mh) (car mh))
    (define (multihash-digest mh) (caddr mh))

Dual-Hash Period

    ;; During migration, store under both hashes
    (define (cas-put/migrate content old-algo new-algo)
      (let ((old-hash (hash-with old-algo content))
            (new-hash (hash-with new-algo content)))
        (cas-put-raw old-hash content)
        (cas-put-raw new-hash content)
        ;; Link old to new
        (ref-set (string-append "migrate/" old-hash) new-hash)
        new-hash))

    ;; Lookup follows migration links
    (define (cas-get/migrate hash)
      (let ((migrated (ref-get (string-append "migrate/" hash))))
        (cas-get (or migrated hash))))

Migration Manifest

    (migration-manifest
      (from-algorithm sha256)
      (to-algorithm sha384)
      (started-at 1767700000)
      (status in-progress)
      (migrated 4723)
      (remaining 1892)
      (mappings
        (("sha256:abc..." . "sha384:def...")
         ("sha256:123..." . "sha384:456...")
         ...)))

Verification During Migration

    (define (verify-migration hash)
      "Verify object under both old and new hash"
      (let* ((content (cas-get hash))
             (old-hash (sha256 content))
             (new-hash (sha384 content)))
        (and (or (equal? hash old-hash)
                 (equal? hash new-hash))
             (equal? (ref-get (string-append "migrate/" old-hash))
                     new-hash))))

Security Considerations

Hash Collision Attacks

SHA-256 provides 128-bit collision resistance. No practical attacks known.

If SHA-256 is ever broken:

    ;; Multihash for algorithm agility
    (define (multihash algo data)
      (case algo
        ((sha256) (cons 'sha256 (sha256 data)))
        ((sha384) (cons 'sha384 (sha384 data)))
        ((blake3) (cons 'blake3 (blake3 data)))))

Length Extension Attacks

SHA-256 is vulnerable to length extension. For authentication, use HMAC:

    (define (cas-mac key hash)
      (hmac-sha256 key hash))

Timing Attacks

Hash comparison MUST be constant-time:

    (define (hash-equal? a b)
      (let ((result 0))
        (do ((i 0 (+ i 1)))
            ((= i 32) (zero? result))
          (set! result (bitwise-ior result
                        (bitwise-xor (blob-ref a i) (blob-ref b i)))))))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Performance Considerations

Caching

    ;; LRU cache for hot objects
    (define cas-cache (make-lru-cache 1000))

    (define (cas-get/cached hash)
      (or (lru-get cas-cache hash)
          (let ((content (cas-get hash)))
            (lru-put! cas-cache hash content)
            content)))

Parallel Hashing

Large files benefit from parallel hashing of chunks.

SSD Optimization

Random access pattern. Use write-ahead log for durability:

    (define (cas-put/durable content)
      (let ((hash (sha256 content)))
        (wal-append hash content)
        (write-blob (hash->path hash) content)
        (wal-commit hash)
        hash))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scope and Constraints

This specification describes a single-realm model. The following are
explicitly deferred to future work:

In Scope (Current)

- One soup (unified object directory)
- One root policy (cyberspace-wide)
- One M-of-N consensus (founding confederation)
- Principals, agents, wormholes as soup objects
- Object-level statistics and auditing
- Rollback strategies by object nature

Explicitly Deferred

- Per-realm security policies
- Nested consensus (enclaves with own M-of-N)
- Enclave federation and policy inheritance
- Realm instantiation via consensus vote
- Policy attenuation (tighten but not loosen)

Rationale: Enclaves running their own consensus policies is a very hard
problem space. The single-realm model must be solid and proven before
subdivision. Premature federation is premature optimization.

When ready, realm policies would:
1. Require consensus vote from root to instantiate
2. Clone root policy as starting point
3. Run realm-local M-of-N for amendments
4. Allow root revocation as nuclear option

This is authorization territory - SPKI delegation chains, capability
attenuation. Constrained away for now.

Design Philosophy

- Newton: The data model (soup, objects, queries)
- Stephenson: The prose (engineering-grounded, mathematically honest)
- Not Gibson: No style over substance (the aesthetic dates; the math doesn't)

Rough consensus, running code, and cryptography that actually works.
