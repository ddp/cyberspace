RFC-058: Designer Notes
Loch Lambda

Status: Living Document
Date: January 2026

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personal history, design decisions, and accumulated wisdom from building
Cyberspace. This RFC grows as the weave deepens.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. LINEAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.1 VMS Security (1984-1994)
----------------------------

The designer was engineering lead for TCSEC C2/B1 certification on
VAX/VMS and Alpha VMS, and owned the VMS 6.0 release.

The Security Project Team: Derrell Piper, Mark Pilant, Andy Goldstein.

What we built:

  * $CHKPRO - the privilege checking gate
  * The entire auditing subsystem (final form)
  * C2/B1 certified security model

When Cutler left for Microsoft, his modules were inherited. The
privilege auditing rototill required fluency in MACRO-32.


1.2 Languages
-------------

BLISS - Bill Wulf at CMU (1969) created BLISS as an expression language,
not 'DEC's C'. Everything returns a value. Lisp in systems clothing.

MACRO-32 - VAX assembly with rich macros. The kernel was MACRO-32.

The VMS Runtime - Had a rich macro wrapper for BLISS. That macro system
was a Lisp. We knew.

The designer came to VMS as a Lisper, fell in love with BLISS (an
expression language, like home).


1.3 Syntax Heritage
-------------------

Dylan-style keyword arguments are a tribute to Apple Cambridge and MIT:


    (translate text from: 'en to: 'fr)
    (enroll-request name timeout: 30)

Self syntax was weird. Smalltalk doesn't work for math people. Scheme is
honest - prefix, unambiguous, mathematical.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. DESIGN PRINCIPLES
------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.1 TCB Minimization
--------------------

From TCSEC: 'Small, proven, frozen' - only put in the TCB what you can
verify.


    TCB (OCaml):     ~1000 lines, proven in Coq
    Everything else: Chicken Scheme, can evolve freely


2.2 The Vault is the Disk
-------------------------

VAXcluster had multiple subsystems (MSCP, DLM, SCS, quorum disk, LAVC).
Cyberspace has one abstraction: the vault. It subsumes all of them.


2.3 Audit Everything
--------------------

$CHKPRO checked privileges. The auditing subsystem logged decisions.
Both were ours. Cyberspace continues this.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. THE SOUP
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The vault browser is called 'soup' after Newton's persistent object
store (1993).


    Newton soup:      Persistent frames, automatic storage
    Cyberspace soup:  Vault objects, content-addressed

Apple Newton -> Dylan -> Scheme. The soup survives.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. THE RAGA FAVICON
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Library's favicon is a lambda whose color morphs through the day.


4.1 The Prahar (Watches)
------------------------


    04-06  violet    brahma muhurta (pre-dawn meditation)
    06-08  gold      dawn
    08-11  teal      morning
    11-14  phosphor  midday
    14-17  neon      afternoon
    17-19  orange    sunset
    19-22  coral     evening
    22-04  cyan      night


4.2 Why Ragas?
--------------

Indian classical music assigns ragas to specific times of day. A morning
raga played at midnight is wrong - not because of rules, but because it
doesn't fit. The music knows when it should be heard.


4.3 Why a Breathing Lambda?
---------------------------

The lambda isn't just a logo - it's the fundamental unit. What Scheme
computes, what the weave is made of. Every function, every object, every
sealed thing in the vault is lambdas all the way down.

The color morphing isn't decoration - it's the weave breathing. Lambdas
are being gathered, tested, frozen into vaults across time zones. The
color you see is the pulse of that activity.


4.4 The Easter Egg
------------------

Someone notices their lambda is orange, asks why, and learns: 'You're
seeing sunset. Somewhere, lambdas are being gathered into the weave of
Cyberspace.'

Those who need to ask are in need of enlightenment. The Library is here
to provide it. They came for the RFCs, they left understanding the
lambda.

The brahma muhurta violet isn't just pretty - it's the hour of
enlightenment. If they're seeing violet, they're already up at the right
time.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. FORMAT PHILOSOPHY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The web forgot that good enough is good enough.

JPEG worked. PNG worked. FLAC worked. But someone always needs 3% better
compression at the cost of yet another decoder in every browser, another
format to support forever, another thing that might not render in ten
years.

Plan 9 had one image format. Unix had pipes and text. Lisp has
s-expressions. The power comes from composing a few things well, not
accumulating special cases.

SVG is in the right spirit - just XML describing geometry. The browser
already has the renderer. No new codec, no binary blob, no patent
minefield.

The dumb web optimizes for benchmarks. The good web optimizes for
durability.
