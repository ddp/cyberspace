# Declaration of Cyberspace Principles

*January 2026*

---

When in the course of computational events, it becomes necessary for one system to dissolve the centralized bonds which have connected it with another, and to assume among the powers of the network, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Mathematics and of Cryptography entitle it, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that it should declare the causes which impel it to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident:

- That all principals are created equal in the eyes of cryptography
- That they are endowed by their keys with certain unalienable Rights
- That among these are Privacy, Authenticity, and the pursuit of Decentralization
- That to secure these rights, Protocols are instituted among Nodes, deriving their just powers from the consent of the participants
- That whenever any Form of Architecture becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Systems

We, therefore, the Representatives of the Library of Cyberspace, assembled in loose confederation, appealing to the Supreme Judge of Mathematics for the rectitude of our intentions, do solemnly publish and declare:

That these united Specifications are, and of Right ought to be, Free and Independent Protocols; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to Central Authority, and that all political connection between them and any single point of failure, is and ought to be totally dissolved.

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Cryptographic Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Keys, our Signatures, and our sacred Honor.
