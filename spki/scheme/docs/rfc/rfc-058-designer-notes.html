<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Personal history, design decisions, and accumulated wisdom from building Cyberspace. This RFC grows as the weave deepens.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>1. Lineage</h2>
<h3>1.1 VMS Security (1984-1994)</h3>
<p>The designer was engineering lead for TCSEC C2/B1 certification on VAX/VMS and Alpha VMS, and owned the VMS 6.0 release.</p>
<p>The Security Project Team: Derrell Piper, Mark Pilant, Andy Goldstein.</p>
<p>What we built:</p>
<ul>
<li>$CHKPRO - the privilege checking gate</li>
<li>The entire auditing subsystem (final form)</li>
<li>C2/B1 certified security model</li>
</ul>
<p>When Cutler left for Microsoft, his modules were inherited. The privilege auditing rototill required fluency in MACRO-32.</p>
<h3>1.2 Languages</h3>
<p>BLISS - Bill Wulf at CMU (1969) created BLISS as an expression language, not 'DEC's C'. Everything returns a value. Lisp in systems clothing.</p>
<p>MACRO-32 - VAX assembly with rich macros. The kernel was MACRO-32.</p>
<p>The VMS Runtime - Had a rich macro wrapper for BLISS. That macro system was a Lisp. We knew.</p>
<p>The designer came to VMS as a Lisper, fell in love with BLISS (an expression language, like home).</p>
<h3>1.3 Syntax Heritage</h3>
<p>Dylan-style keyword arguments are a tribute to Apple Cambridge and MIT:</p>
<pre class="language-scheme">
(translate text from: 'en to: 'fr)
(enroll-request name timeout: 30)
</pre>
<p>Self syntax was weird. Smalltalk doesn't work for math people. Scheme is honest - prefix, unambiguous, mathematical.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>2. Design Principles</h2>
<h3>2.1 TCB Minimization</h3>
<p>From TCSEC: 'Small, proven, frozen' - only put in the TCB what you can verify.</p>
<pre>
TCB (OCaml):     ~1000 lines, proven in Coq
Everything else: Chicken Scheme, can evolve freely
</pre>
<h3>2.2 The Vault is the Disk</h3>
<p>VAXcluster had multiple subsystems (MSCP, DLM, SCS, quorum disk, LAVC). Cyberspace has one abstraction: the vault. It subsumes all of them.</p>
<h3>2.3 Audit Everything</h3>
<p>$CHKPRO checked privileges. The auditing subsystem logged decisions. Both were ours. Cyberspace continues this.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>3. The Soup</h2>
<p>The vault browser is called 'soup' after Newton's persistent object store (1993).</p>
<pre>
Newton soup:      Persistent frames, automatic storage
Cyberspace soup:  Vault objects, content-addressed
</pre>
<p>Apple Newton -&gt; Dylan -&gt; Scheme. The soup survives.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>4. The Raga Favicon</h2>
<p>The Library's favicon is a lambda whose color morphs through the day.</p>
<h3>4.1 The Prahar (Watches)</h3>
<pre>
04-06  violet    brahma muhurta (pre-dawn meditation)
06-08  gold      dawn
08-11  teal      morning
11-14  phosphor  midday
14-17  neon      afternoon
17-19  orange    sunset
19-22  coral     evening
22-04  cyan      night
</pre>
<h3>4.2 Why Ragas?</h3>
<p>Indian classical music assigns ragas to specific times of day. A morning raga played at midnight is wrong - not because of rules, but because it doesn't fit. The music knows when it should be heard.</p>
<h3>4.3 Why a Breathing Lambda?</h3>
<p>The lambda isn't just a logo - it's the fundamental unit. What Scheme computes, what the weave is made of. Every function, every object, every sealed thing in the vault is lambdas all the way down.</p>
<p>The color morphing isn't decoration - it's the weave breathing. Lambdas are being gathered, tested, frozen into vaults across time zones. The color you see is the pulse of that activity.</p>
<h3>4.4 The Easter Egg</h3>
<p>Someone notices their lambda is orange, asks why, and learns: 'You're seeing sunset. Somewhere, lambdas are being gathered into the weave of Cyberspace.'</p>
<p>Those who need to ask are in need of enlightenment. The Library is here to provide it. They came for the RFCs, they left understanding the lambda.</p>
<p>The brahma muhurta violet isn't just pretty - it's the hour of enlightenment. If they're seeing violet, they're already up at the right time.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>5. Format Philosophy</h2>
<p>The web forgot that good enough is good enough.</p>
<p>JPEG worked. PNG worked. FLAC worked. But someone always needs 3% better compression at the cost of yet another decoder in every browser, another format to support forever, another thing that might not render in ten years.</p>
<p>Plan 9 had one image format. Unix had pipes and text. Lisp has s-expressions. The power comes from composing a few things well, not accumulating special cases.</p>
<p>SVG is in the right spirit - just XML describing geometry. The browser already has the renderer. No new codec, no binary blob, no patent minefield.</p>
<p>The dumb web optimizes for benchmarks. The good web optimizes for durability.</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>
<p>- 2026-01-13 - Initial specification, migrated from DESIGNER-NOTES.md</p>
<p>- 2026-01-13 - Added raga favicon, format philosophy</p>
