# RFC-000: The Library of Cyberspace

**A Friendly Guide to Digital Preservation**

*For everyone, not just programmers*

---

## What Is This?

Imagine a library where:

- **Your work is safe** - because friends keep copies for each other
- **Nothing gets lost** - even if one computer fails
- **You know who made what** - like a signature on a painting
- **It belongs to everyone** - like a community garden

That's the Library of Cyberspace.

---

## Why Does This Matter?

We all have things worth keeping:

- Family photos
- Creative work
- Research and writing
- Code we've written
- Things we want to pass on

Right now, most of this lives on company servers. That works great... until:

- The company shuts down
- Your account gets locked
- The service changes
- Something just disappears

**Friends don't disappear.** Friends keep copies.

---

## The Simple Idea

What if preserving things worked like borrowing books from friends?

```
    You ←────→ Friend ←────→ Friend
     │           │             │
     └───────────┴─────────────┘
               │
      Everyone helps everyone.
      Like a neighborhood library,
      but for anything digital.
```

That's really all this is.

## How It Works

### 1. You Sign Your Work

When you create something, you sign it digitally. Like initialing a document - but impossible to forge.

### 2. You Share With Friends

You give copies to people you trust. They might share with people they trust too.

### 3. Anyone Can Check

If someone has a copy, they can verify: "Yes, this is really from that person, unchanged."

### 4. Together, Nothing Is Lost

No single computer has to hold everything. Together, friends keep it all safe.

---

## Why "A Circle of Friends"?

This isn't a company or an organization. It's just people who:

- Care about keeping things safe
- Have some storage to spare
- Want to help each other out

Think of it like a book club, but instead of reading together, you're preserving together.

---

## What Can You Keep?

Anything digital that matters to you:

- Writing and documents
- Photos and artwork
- Music and recordings
- Software and code
- Research and notes
- Family history

If it's worth keeping, it belongs in the library.

## How Is This Different?

| Cloud Storage | Library of Cyberspace |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Company holds your files | Friends hold copies |
| You rent space | You share space |
| One place, one copy | Many places, many copies |
| Could disappear | Friends don't disappear |

---

## The Heart of It

### Friends Helping Friends

That's really what this is. Not a product. Not a startup. Just people who think some things are worth preserving, helping each other do it.

### Many Hands Make Light Work

No one person keeps everything. But together? Together we can keep it all.

---

## Who Is This For?

- **Writers** who want their work to last
- **Families** who want to preserve memories
- **Researchers** who care about their data
- **Artists** who want their work to survive
- **Anyone** who has ever lost files they cared about
- **Friends** who want to help each other

---

## How Do I Start?

1. Set aside some storage on your computer
2. Find friends who want to do the same
3. Share what you want to preserve
4. Keep copies of what friends share with you
5. That's it - you're part of the library

---

## Our Promise to Each Other

- **We keep copies** - so nothing is lost
- **We verify authenticity** - so nothing is changed
- **We share generously** - because that's what friends do
- **We help each other** - because together we're stronger

---

## One Last Thing

The Library of Alexandria was the greatest library of the ancient world. It burned, and we lost so much.

We can do better now. Not with a building, but with friendship. Not with guards, but with mathematics. Not with one place, but with many.

**The Library of Cyberspace is just friends, keeping copies, for each other.**

*"Many hands make light work."*
