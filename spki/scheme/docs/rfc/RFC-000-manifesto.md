# RFC-000: The Library of Cyberspace

**A Manifesto for Digital Preservation**

*For everyone, not just programmers*

---

## What Is This?

Imagine a library that:

- **Cannot burn down** - because copies exist everywhere
- **Has no landlord** - no company owns it
- **Cannot be censored** - no one can remove books
- **Proves authenticity** - you know who wrote what
- **Lives forever** - as long as friends keep copies

That's the Library of Cyberspace.

---

## The Problem

Today, your digital life depends on companies:

- Your photos live on Google's servers
- Your code lives on GitHub
- Your documents live on Dropbox
- Your messages live on Signal's servers

What happens when:

- The company goes bankrupt?
- They change their terms of service?
- They decide your content violates policy?
- A government demands they delete something?
- They get hacked?

**You lose everything.**

---

## The Solution

What if you and your friends just... kept copies?

```
You ←────→ Your Friend ←────→ Their Friend
 │              │                   │
 └──────────────┴───────────────────┘
                │
        Everyone has a copy.
        No one is in charge.
        Math proves who wrote what.
```

That's it. That's the whole idea.

## How It Works (Simply)

### 1. You Sign Things

When you create something, you sign it with your personal key. Like a wax seal on a letter, but unforgeable.

### 2. You Share With Friends

You give copies to people you trust. They give copies to people they trust.

### 3. Anyone Can Verify

Anyone with a copy can check: "Yes, this was really signed by that person, and no one has changed it."

### 4. No One Controls It

There's no master server. No company. No single point of failure. Just people keeping copies for each other.

---

## Why "Confederacy"?

A **confederation** is a group of independent parties who cooperate voluntarily.

- No one gives orders
- No one asks permission
- Everyone helps everyone
- Trust is earned, not granted

Think of it like neighbors with spare keys to each other's houses. You trust them because you know them, not because a company verified them.

## What Can You Store?

Anything digital:

- Documents and writing
- Source code and software
- Research and data
- Art and music
- Records and archives
- Anything worth preserving

---

## What Makes This Different?

| Traditional Cloud | Library of Cyberspace |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Company owns servers | Friends own copies |
| Terms of service | Mathematical proof |
| Can be shut down | Cannot be shut down |
| Trust the company | Trust the math |
| Subscription fees | Just storage costs |
| They can read it | Only you can read it |
| Single point of failure | No single point |

---

## The Philosophy

### "A Loose Confederacy of Friends"

We don't need:
- Venture capital
- Data centers
- Terms of service
- Permission from anyone

We just need:
- Friends who care about preservation
- Computers with storage
- A way to talk to each other
- Mathematics that works

### "E Pluribus Unum"

*Out of many, one.*

Each person keeps their own library. Together, we keep everything. No single person has to store it all. No single person can destroy it all.

---

## Is This Legal?

Yes. You're just:
- Keeping copies of things you have rights to
- Sharing with friends who want copies
- Using cryptography (which is legal)
- Running software on your own computers

You're not:
- Pirating copyrighted content
- Breaking into systems
- Hiding from law enforcement
- Doing anything you wouldn't do with physical books

---

## Who Is This For?

- **Writers** who want their work to survive
- **Researchers** who want data preserved
- **Developers** who want code to outlive companies
- **Archivists** who care about digital preservation
- **Anyone** who's ever lost files when a service shut down
- **Friends** who want to help each other

---

## How Do I Join?

You don't "join" - there's no membership.

You:
1. Set up storage on your computer
2. Connect with friends who do the same
3. Share what you want to preserve
4. Keep copies of what others share
5. That's it

---

## The Promise

We mutually pledge to each other:

- **To keep copies** - so nothing is lost
- **To verify signatures** - so nothing is forged
- **To share freely** - so knowledge spreads
- **To ask no permission** - because none is needed
- **To trust the math** - because it doesn't lie

---

## One Last Thing

This isn't about technology. It's about **trust**.

Technology just makes it possible. The actual library is made of people who care enough to keep copies, verify authenticity, and pass things on.

The Library of Alexandria burned. We can do better.
