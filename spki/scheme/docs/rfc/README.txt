Library of Cyberspace
The Soup. The Realm. The Seal.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THIS?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine a library where:

  * Your work is safe - because friends keep copies for each other
  * Nothing gets lost - even if one computer fails
  * You know who made what - like a signature on a painting
  * It belongs to everyone - like a community garden

That's the Library of Cyberspace.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We all have things worth keeping: family photos, creative work,
research, code, things we want to pass on.

Right now, most of this lives on company servers. That works great...
until the company shuts down, your account gets locked, or something
just disappears.

Friends don't disappear. Friends keep copies.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SIMPLE IDEA
------------------------------------------------------------------------

What if preserving things worked like borrowing books from friends?


        You <----> Friend <----> Friend
         |           |             |
         +-----------+-------------+
                     |
          Everyone helps everyone.
          Like a neighborhood library,
          but for anything digital.

That's really all this is.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
OUR PROMISE TO EACH OTHER
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * We keep copies - so nothing is lost
  * We verify authenticity - so nothing is changed
  * We share generously - because that's what friends do
  * We help each other - because together we're stronger

A NEWTON FOR CYBERSPACE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 1993, Apple made something called the Newton. It had a revolutionary
idea: your stuff just exists. You don't save files or open documents.
Things float in a soup of objects, and you find them by asking
questions.

The Newton died because it needed a network that didn't exist yet. We
have that network now.

We're building the Newton it deserves: a soup that spans friends,
objects that prove themselves, identity without permission, memory that
can't be rewritten.

RFC PURPOSE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

These Request for Comments documents serve as:

  * Design Records: Why decisions were made
  * Implementation Specifications: How features work
  * Security Analysis: Threat models and mitigations
  * Future Reference: Understanding the system later

LINEAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cyberspace stands on giants:


  System         Era    What We Learned                                        
  VMS Clusters   1983   SET HOST - distributed presence                        
  Newton         1993   The soup - objects as medium, queries as navigation    
  General Magic  1994   Agents that travel, carry intent, return with results  
  SPKI/SDSI      1996   Capabilities, not identities                           
  AS/400         1988   Capability-based addressing                            
  Cambridge CAP  1970s  Hardware capabilities                                  

Cyberspace is their synthesis: local-first realms, federated via
capabilities, with agents swimming in the soup.

  Term       Definition                                                                                       
  Realm      A node's place in cyberspace - vault, principal, capabilities, objects. Local-first, sovereign.  
  Vault      The local content-addressed object store. The realm's storage.                                   
  Principal  A node's cryptographic identity (Ed25519 public key).                                            
  Soup       The queryable object space. A wilderness of mirrors.                                             
  Seal       Cryptographic binding - signing, archiving, committing. The primary verb.

The Library of Alexandria burned. We can do better now.

Not with a building, but with friendship. Not with guards, but with
mathematics.
