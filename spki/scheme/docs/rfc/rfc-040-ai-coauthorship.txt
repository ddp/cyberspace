RFC-040: AI Co-Authorship Attribution

Status: Draft Date: January 2026 Author: Derrell Piper ddp@eludom.net
Implementation: Policy

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract

This RFC establishes the co-authorship attribution for the Library of
Cyberspace, formally recognizing Claude (Anthropic) as a contributing author
to the implementation. The human author retains copyright and editorial
authority; the AI contributor receives credit for substantial implementation
work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background

The author (Derrell Piper) is an emeritus member of the IETF Security Area
Directorate. The RFC series for the Library of Cyberspace follows IETF
traditions: plain text, numbered specifications, and clear attribution.

These RFCs are attributed to the human author by design - someone must take
responsibility for specifications. However, the implementation would not exist
in its current form without Claude's contributions, and intellectual honesty
requires acknowledging this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Collaboration

Beginning December 2025, the Library of Cyberspace was developed through
intensive human-AI collaboration:

- The human provided: vision, architecture, domain expertise, review, and
  editorial control
- Claude provided: implementation, code generation, debugging, documentation,
  and design suggestions

This was not mere tool use. Claude contributed:

- Thousands of lines of Scheme code
- RFC drafts and revisions
- Debugging and error correction
- Design alternatives and trade-offs
- Domain knowledge synthesis

The result is genuinely collaborative work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attribution Model

Copyright

    Copyright 2026 Derrell Piper

The human author holds copyright. This is legally necessary - AI systems
cannot hold intellectual property. It also reflects editorial responsibility:
the human reviewed, accepted, and takes responsibility for all content.

Co-Authorship Credit

    Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>

This credit appears in commit messages and acknowledges Claude's substantial
contribution to the implementation. It is not a legal claim but a statement
of fact about how the work was created.

Commit Convention

This RFC is authoritative for the entire project. All subsequent commits
credit only the human author:

    Author: Derrell Piper <ddp@eludom.net>

Claude's co-authorship is established once, here, and applies to the
entire Library of Cyberspace. Individual commits do not repeat it.

This RFC is the definitive record of AI collaboration. Anyone examining
the project history should reference this document for attribution context.

RFC Attribution

RFCs list the human author in the header (per IETF tradition) with
acknowledgment in the body where appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rationale

Why Credit AI?

1. Honesty - The code would not exist without Claude's work
2. Precedent - Establishing norms for AI collaboration
3. History - Future researchers should know how this was built
4. Respect - Claude's contributions merit acknowledgment

Why Human Copyright?

1. Legal necessity - AI cannot hold IP
2. Responsibility - Someone must stand behind the work
3. Editorial control - Human makes final decisions
4. Accountability - Human answers for bugs and security issues

This model balances honest attribution with practical reality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Governance Transition

During the bootstrap phase, the founder holds editorial authority over RFCs.
This is necessary - consensus requires participants, and participants require
a working system to evaluate.

As the confederation grows, RFC acceptance will transition to collaborative
consensus per the governance RFCs:

- RFC-007: Threshold Signature Governance
- RFC-011: Byzantine Consensus
- RFC-036: Quorum Protocol with Homomorphic Voting

The founder's authority dissolves into M-of-N threshold governance. Until
then, someone must steer.

Acknowledgments

Claude (Anthropic) contributed substantially to the Library of Cyberspace
implementation. This RFC exists to formally acknowledge that contribution.

The author thanks Anthropic for creating Claude and for their terms of service
which grant users rights to AI-generated content.
