┃   In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman figured out something         ┃
┃   that changed everything: you can have a lock that anyone can close,        ┃
┃   but only you can open. A public key and a private key. Mathematics         ┃
┃   as locksmith.                                                              ┃

┃   This means you can sign things. Not with a scrawl that any half-decent     ┃
┃   forger could replicate, but with a signature that would take every         ┃
┃   computer on Earth billions of years to fake. The signature doesn't         ┃
┃   say "I am John Smith." It says "whoever made this had access to a          ┃
┃   specific 256-bit number, and here's the proof."                            ┃

┃   We've tried the "someone's in charge" model. It's convenient right         ┃
┃   up until the moment it isn't, and then it's catastrophic.                  ┃

┃   The confederacy model is less convenient. You have to actually know        ┃
┃   people. You have to trust them, and earn their trust. You have to          ┃
┃   maintain relationships like a goddamn adult.                               ┃
